<current_query>
[B] said:I’m looking forward to hearing about it

### Task:
- Select an index [i] in <dialogue_history>. The content from this index [i] to the end of the dialogue_history constitutes a complete context with a complete theme, which can provide sufficient information for <current_query>.
- The content before the selected index [i] has little relevance to <current_query>, and this index [i] constitutes a theme transition.

### Selection rules:
1. **The most continuous context before and after** (The complete context formed by the content from the selected index to <current_query> (hereinafter referred to as the [context window]) can provide sufficient information for <current_query>.
2. The selected [context window] is the most relevant to <current_query>.
3. All the content referred to in <current_query> is included in the selected [context window].
4. Only return the index [i], no need to return other content.
5. If there's no context that can provide sufficient information for <current_query> or the information in [context window] has no relevance with <current_query>, return [-1]

### Input and output examples
#### Example 1
Input example
<dialogue_history>

[0] [A] said:I was thinking of trying out a new recipe this weekend. What do you think?
[1] [B] said:That sounds fun! What kind of recipe are you planning to make?
[2] [A] said:Maybe something with chicken. I’m in the mood for a hearty meal.
[3] [B] said:Nice! I love chicken dishes. Any specific recipe you have in mind?
[4] [A] said:I’m thinking of trying a chicken casserole with lots of veggies.
[5] [B] said:Yum! That sounds delicious. I’m sure it’ll turn out great.
[6] [A] said:I hope so! I’ve never made a casserole before, but I’m excited to try.
[7] [B] said:I’m sure you’ll nail it. Casseroles are pretty easy to make.
[8] [A] said:Thanks for the encouragement! I’ll let you know how it goes.

<current_query>

[B] said:I’m looking forward to hearing about it!

Expected output
[7]

Basis for selection
The 'it' mentioned in <current_query> refers to the 'Casseroles' mentioned in [7]. Thus, the index from [7] to <current_query> constitutes a complete context. This window is the most continuous and is most relevant to the "current_query".


#### Example 2

Input example
The value of `current_query` in the JSON text you provided `"[A] Wow, that sounds beautiful! I’ll have to check it out sometime."` has an incorrect outer quotation mark. There is an extra double quotation mark, and it should be `[A] Wow, that sounds beautiful! I’ll have to check it out sometime.`. The following is the converted result after correcting the error:

<dialogue_history>

[0] [A] said:Hey, how's it going? Any fun plans for the weekend?
[1] [B] said:Not much, just planning to catch up on some work. You?
[2] [A] said:I was thinking of going for a hike, maybe explore some new trails.
[3] [B] said:That sounds amazing! Where are you thinking of going?
[4] [A] said:There's a trail near the lake I haven't explored yet. Might check it out.
[5] [B] said:That sounds awesome. You should definitely go!
[6] [A] said:Yeah, I hope the weather stays nice. Do you hike often?
[7] [B] said:I do enjoy it, but I haven't had time lately. I should get back into it.
[8] [A] said:You should! It’s such a refreshing experience to be out in nature.
[9] [B] said:Absolutely! Hiking really helps clear my mind and recharge.
[10] [A] said:Do you have a favorite trail?
[11] [B] said:I love the one by the mountains. It's a bit challenging, but totally worth it for the view at the top!

<current_query>

[A] said:Wow, that sounds beautiful! I’ll have to check it out sometime.

Expected output
[9]

Basis for selection
The 'that sounds beautiful' mentioned in <current_query> refers to [11], and 'check it' refers to the favorite trail in [10].
Only when sentence [10] is combined with [9] can a complete context be formed. So [9] is finally selected.

#### Example 3

Input example
<dialogue_history>

[0] [A] said:Do you have any travel plans coming up?
[1] [B] said:Not really, but I’ve been thinking about visiting Japan sometime this year.
[2] [A] said:That sounds amazing! What would you want to see in Japan?
[3] [B] said:Definitely the cherry blossoms and the temples. I’ve heard they’re beautiful.
[4] [A] said:Oh, I’ve always wanted to see the cherry blossoms in full bloom!
[5] [B] said:Same! It’s on my bucket list for sure.
[6] [A] said:Maybe we should plan a trip together. It’d be so much fun.
[7] [B] said:That would be incredible! Let’s start looking at dates and details.
[8] [A] said:Sounds like a plan! We’ll make it happen.
[9] [B] said:I’m really looking forward to it!

<current_query>

[A] said:When do you think would be the best time to go?

Expected output
[6]

Basis for selection
The 'When ... to go' mentioned in <current_query> forms a unified context with the 'trip' mentioned in [6]. So [6] is finally selected. 

#### Example 4

Input example
<dialogue_history>

<current_query>

[A] said:When do you think would be the best time to go?
