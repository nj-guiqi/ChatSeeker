I want to put my passions and abilities to use for causes I really care about.\nJames said:Wow, John that sounds great! I'm sure with your skills and passion, you could do some really cool things with nonprofits. Here's a pic I took when I volunteered last month. It was really rewarding to see how little gifts can do so much!\nJohn said:That's awesome, James! Was it cool to see the impact of the gifts? Can you tell me more about the organization you volunteered with?\nJames said:It was great to see how much a simple act of kindness can mean to someone in need.
