Since we last spoke, I've been looking for a doggo to adopt - browsing websites, visiting shelters and asking friends of theirs. It's been both fun and annoying!\nAudrey said:Sounds like a fun and demanding task! Getting to meet new pups must bring so much happiness. What  do you think you can do to make the process smoother?\nAndrew said:Meeting all these adorable pups has been awesome! For those considering getting a pup, the size of living space and the exercise needs of the breed are important. For me, a person living in an apartment, a smaller dog would be best, but if one is active, consider getting one that loves to play and run.\nAudrey said:That's some good advice! It's important to consider the space and energy needs of a dog.\nAndrew said:Yeah! Finding a pet-friendly place to live has been tough too. I'm contacting landlords and checking out neighborhoods to find the perfect spot.\nAudrey said:Guessing it's tough to find housing. Any particular part of town you want to live in?\nAndrew said:I'm looking for a place near a park or woods, so I can stay close to nature and give the dog a large open space to run around\nAudrey said:That's a good plan! I'm lucky to have a park near me - it's great for my pup's walks. Last Friday we took a road trip - we went to a beautiful national park and my dogs had a blast! It was an awesome trip!\nAndrew said:Nice! Glad the pups had a great road trip. Do you take them on road trips often?\nAudrey said:I take them on road trips once every couple of months. It's a great way for them to explore and stay active.\nAndrew said:Wow, that's awesome! I really wish I could go on a road trip with a furry companion.\nAudrey said:It's a cool experience. Having your furry friends on a road trip is an amazing experience. They make it really fun and exciting. It's definitely something to look forward to!\nAndrew said:Adding that to my bucket list! Can't wait for the day I actually go on a trip with my dog!\nAudrey said:Good luck with your search! Fingers crossed you find the perfect one. | [context] | Andrew said:Thanks!

My week's been good - taking care of my four doggies and making sure they're happy and healthy took up most of my free time. Also, exciting news! I signed up for a workshop about bonding with my pet next month. Can't wait to learn new stuff and strengthen my bond with my pets. What's up with you?\nAndrew said:That's awesome! Glad have the opportunity to bond with your pets. That workshop sounds cool. Where did you hear about it? And the one in the picture is adorable!\nAudrey said:I know right? I saw this workshop flyer at my local pet store. It was a positive reinforcement training class and I wanted to give it a shot. The volunteer in the store was nice enough to let me meet their dog \u2013 he was so friendly and playful!\nAndrew said:Cool! Positive reinforcement can really help you bond with your dogs. Do you think they'll catch on quickly?\nAudrey said:I'm sure they'll catch on really quick! They're quick learners and love rewards! Can't wait to learn how to train them better.\nAndrew said:That's awesome! Keep me updated on their progress.\nAudrey said:Definitely! I'll keep you updated on how it all goes and how my pups are doing. Fingers crossed they'll be extra behaved. And I'll let you know some tips on training your future dog as well!\nAndrew said:Thanks! I'm excited to hear about it. Have a great time at the workshop!\nAudrey said:I'll definitely have a good time and make the most of it. I'm sure this is a must learn for any dog owner.\nAndrew said:You think so? Wow, you must be a good salesperson because I'm almost sold on this class haha.\nAudrey said:Haha, I just think its important to have pets learn how to behave on a positive reinforcement way. Punishment is never the proper way for pets ya know?\nAndrew said:Yeah I would't want to be punished, let alone puppies and dogs.\nAudrey said:Right!? I don't want to hurt any of my dogs. Just by thinking of it gives me pain.\nAndrew said:Yeah I feel you. Anyways, let me look into their classes. I'll talk to you soon, have fun!\nAudrey said:Yup, ttyl! | [context] | Audrey said:Hey how's it going? Yesterday took my pups to the park, it was awesome!

It was great seeing them having fun together. Their joy was infectious and made my heart feel so full.\nAndrew said:That's so heartwarming! Seeing them enjoy themselves like that is always a joy. :)\nAudrey said:I'm so happy seeing them have a great time. Last week I even got some new beds for them, just to give them some extra comfort now the weather's cooling down and they were happy! It's incredible how such a simple thing can bring them so much happiness.\nAndrew said:Animals can really find joy in the simple things. That was so nice of you. Do you have any pictures of the new beds?\nAudrey said:Sure! Here's a pic of them. Super cozy and comfy. My furry friends love them!\nAndrew said:Do they enjoy snoozing on it?

But with my job and living here, it's been harder to get that feeling back. I feel a void in my heart.\nAudrey said:Yeah, I get how it's like something is missing without being in the nature. But there are still some ways to appreciate it in the city, like getting some plants for your place or taking a trip to the park on the weekends.\nAndrew said:Yeah true. I should get some more plants for my house. Can't beat being outside tho, but they can still bring some peace. I'll look into it. Thanks for the tip!\nAudrey said:Of course! If you need help or advice, just let me know. Plants can make your home so peaceful.\nAndrew said:Thanks! I'll definitely reach out if I need any help or advice. Thanks again for offering!\nAudrey said:No problem at all! Glad to be of assistance.\nAndrew said:Oh you've helped so much. \nAudrey said:Haha i'm just doing what I can do to help.\nAndrew said:Thank you really. Well, take care and say hi to your dogs for me.\nAudrey said:Haha I will. Take care. Talk later!\nAndrew said:Yup, have a great week. \nAudrey said:Have a great week!

I think right now its enough. Unless someday I decide to get another dog. Maybe I'll get another tattoo when that happens.\nAndrew said:I can tell they're a real source of love for you. It's great to have that kind of inspiration. You know what else inspires me? Somewhere like this\nAudrey said:They really bring me joy. It feels great to experience unconditional love!

Did you receive any helpful advice or insights?\nAudrey said:The appointment went okay. It was hectic at first, but the behaviorist checked them out and asked some questions.

It took a while for them to calm down, but all cut up they looked so cute! \nAndrew said:Hey Audrey! Nice to hear from you. Sounds adorable! Do you have any pictures of them all groomed up?\nAudrey said:Here's a pic of them, looking all groomed. Look at those shiny coats! To top it off, they were really good at the salon - I always worry about them in new places.\nAndrew said:Wow, they look great! Love seeing them happy and calm in new places.\nAudrey said:Thanks! It means a lot to see them happy and settled in new places. I guess I'm doing a good job as a doggy mom then, haha! Have you taken your furry friends to the groomers yet?\nAndrew said:No, we haven't got the chance to take them to the groomer yet. But will do that soon! So guess what, I can't help myself but to adpot another dog the other day. Here's a photo of the doggo!\nAudrey said:That's great news! What's the pups name?\nAndrew said:It took us a while to decide, but we ended up going with 'Scout' for our pup - it seemed perfect for their adventurous spirit.\nAudrey said:That's a great name for your pup! Fits their adventurous spirit. What's Scout's first adventure gonna be?\nAndrew said:Thanks! We're gonna take Scout, Toby, and Buddy to a nearby park. It's not big, but we can all have fun and get some fresh air!\nAudrey said:Sounds like a great start for Scout! Start small, and gradually give them more exposure. They'll have a great time, just make sure to keep them leashed.\nAndrew said:Yeah, safety first! For now, we're keeping the new addition on a leash while they get used to being outside. That pic you of your dog at the park is so cute. So we got some essentials for their comfort and entertainment, like a bed, toys, and some puppy pads just in case. It's like their own little safe haven.\nAudrey said:Wow, that's so great that you two are creating a safe and fun space for Scout. It's really important they have a place that makes them feel secure. Slowly introduce Scout to Toby and Buddy, it takes time for the pups to get used to each other too! Scout is so lucky to have you and your girlfriend!  | [context] | Andrew said:Thanks!
