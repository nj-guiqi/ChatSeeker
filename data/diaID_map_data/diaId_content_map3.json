    "D1:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Long time no see! I've been working on a project lately - it's been pretty cool. What about you - any fun projects or hobbies?",
    "D1:3": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! That's cool! I won my first video game tournament last week - so exciting!",
    "D1:4": "Joanna said:Wow Nate! Congrats on winning! Tell me more - what game was it?",
    "D1:5": "Nate said:Thanks! it's a team shooter game.",
    "D1:6": "Joanna said:Wow, great job! What was is called?",
    "D1:7": "Nate said:The game was called Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, and me and my team had a blast to the very end!",
    "D1:8": "Joanna said:Cool, Nate! Sounds like a fun experience, even if I'm not into games.",
    "D1:9": "Nate said:It was! How about you? Do you have any hobbies you love?",
    "D1:10": "Joanna said:Yeah! Besides writing, I also enjoy reading, watching movies, and exploring nature. Anything else you enjoy doing, Nate?",
    "D1:11": "Nate said:Playing video games and watching movies are my main hobbies.",
    "D1:12": "Joanna said:Cool, Nate! So we both have similar interests. What type of movies do you like best?",
    "D1:13": "Nate said:I love action and sci-fi movies, the effects are so cool! What about you, what's your favorite genre?",
    "D1:14": "Joanna said:I'm all about dramas and romcoms. I love getting immersed in the feelings and plots.",
    "D1:15": "Nate said:Wow, movies can be so powerful! Do you have any recommendations for me?",
    "D1:16": "Joanna said:Yeah, totally! Have you seen this romantic drama that's all about memory and relationships? It's such a good one.",
    "D1:17": "Nate said:Oh cool! I might check that one out some time soon! I do love watching classics.",
    "D1:18": "Joanna said:Yep, that movie is awesome. I first watched it around 3 years ago. I even went out and got a physical copy!",
    "D1:19": "Nate said:Sounds cool! Have you seen it a lot? sounds like you know the movie well!",
    "D1:20": "Joanna said:A few times. It's one of my favorites! I really like the idea and the acting.",
    "D1:21": "Nate said:Cool! I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the recommendation!",
    "D1:22": "Joanna said:No problem, Nate! Let me know if you like it!",
    "D2:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Haven't talked in a few days. Crazy things happened to me!",
    "D2:2": "Nate said:Hi Joanna! Long time no see! What's been going on? You sound excited!",
    "D2:3": "Joanna said:Woo! I finally finished my first full screenplay and printed it last Friday. I've been working on for a while, such a relief to have it all done!",
    "D2:4": "Nate said:Wow, that sounds awesome! What's it about? Glad it's all down!",
    "D2:5": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! It's a mix of drama and romance!",
    "D2:6": "Nate said:Wow, that's amazing! How do you feel now that it's finished? Do you have any new plans for it?",
    "D2:7": "Joanna said:Woohoo, Nate! I'm feeling a rollercoaster of emotions - relief, excitement, some anxiety - over finishing this project. Now I'm gonna submit it to some film festivals and (hopefully) get producers and directors to check it out. Here's hoping!",
    "D2:8": "Nate said:Congrats, Joanna! That sounds like a wild experience. Rock on and I hope they love it!",
    "D2:9": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! A mix of emotions for sure. Hopefully, it leads to positive feedback and new opportunities.",
    "D2:10": "Nate said:Yeah, for sure. Hoping for the best! I like having some of these little ones around to keep me calm when things are super important and I'm nervous.",
    "D2:11": "Joanna said:Awww! How long have you had them?",
    "D2:12": "Nate said:I've had them for 3 years now and they bring me tons of joy!",
    "D2:13": "Joanna said:They sure lookl like they do! Adorable!",
    "D2:14": "Nate said:Thanks! The turtles might be small, but both sure have big personalities. I really reccomend having something like these little guys for times of stress.",
    "D2:15": "Joanna said:Good idea, Nate! I'll think about it and maybe get pets of my own soon if I can find any I'm not allergic to. Have you been up to anything recently?",
    "D2:16": "Nate said:Yeah actually! I start to hang out with some people outside of my circle at the tournament. They're pretty cool!",
    "D2:17": "Joanna said:Oh? That sounds sweet! Is it a weird relationship with them being competitors and all?",
    "D2:18": "Nate said:Oh, kind of. Some people are more competitive then others, so I tend to just stick around the more chill people here.",
    "D2:19": "Joanna said:That makes sense! Are you gonna cheer them on even if you lose?",
    "D2:20": "Nate said:Absolutely! I don't expect to win big here, I just like playing for fun!  You mentioned you were allergic to pets earlier, how bad is it?",
    "D2:21": "Joanna said:Oh, its really bad. My face gets all puffy and itchy when I'm around certain animals, so I've always just stayed away.",
    "D2:22": "Nate said:Sorry to hear that. Allergies can be tough. What specifically are you allergic to?",
    "D2:23": "Joanna said:I'm allergic to most reptiles and animals with fur. It can be a bit of a drag, but I find other ways to be happy.",
    "D2:24": "Nate said:Awesome! There are lots of things that can bring you joy without pets. What else brings you joy?",
    "D2:25": "Joanna said:Writing and hanging with friends! That way I can express myself through stories, or just have a good time with people.",
    "D2:26": "Nate said:That's great to hear! Those are both great things. I'm glad to hear you've got other things to help you get through times of axiousness despite not being able to have animals!",
    "D2:27": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Writing helps me create wild worlds with awesome characters. Plus, it's a great way to express my feelings. I can't imagine life without it.",
    "D2:28": "Nate said:Wow, Joanna, that sounds amazing! Keep doing what you love!",
    "D2:29": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! I'll definitely keep pursuing my passion for writing. It means a lot.",
    "D3:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, long time no see! The screenplay I sent in to the film festival has been on my mind all day everyday. I keep bouncing between crazy emotions like relief, excitement and worry! Fingers crossed a producer or director falls in love with it and it ends up on the big screen - that would be awesome!",
    "D3:2": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! It is a big deal! I'm sure its been a wild ride. Sending some positive vibes and hoping someone likes it enough to get it on the big screen - that would be awesome!",
    "D3:3": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate, your support really means a lot. I put a lot of effort into it and I'm crossing my fingers. What about you? Anything new and exciting happening in your life?",
    "D3:4": "Nate said:Thanks, Joanna. Not much has changed for me, but I just discovered that I can make coconut milk icecream and gave it a try. It was actually pretty good, so I'm proud of myself.",
    "D3:5": "Joanna said:Looks delish! Glad you tried something new and it went well. What did you think of it?",
    "D3:6": "Nate said:Super good! It was rich and creamy - might be my new favorite snack!",
    "D3:7": "Joanna said:Great! I love when you try something new and it actually works out. Will you give it another go?",
    "D3:8": "Nate said:Yep, it could be fun! I'm looking forward to trying out different flavors and toppings.",
    "D3:9": "Joanna said:Yum! Sounds great. Got any favorite flavors for dairy-free desserts?",
    "D3:10": "Nate said:I love coconut milk, but I also enjoy chocolate and mixed berry flavors.",
    "D3:11": "Joanna said:Wow, those sound great! Who can say no to chocolate and berries? I'm tempted to try dairy-free flavors now!",
    "D3:12": "Nate said:Well I also made a dairy-free chocolate cake with berries on it the other day, maybe you would like that!",
    "D3:13": "Joanna said:Wow! That sounds yummy! You're so talented. Thanks for sharing your amazing creations! I should really try making one or just pay you a visit and try one for myself!",
    "D3:14": "Nate said:I couldn't agree more! It's always fun experimenting in the kitchen.",
    "D3:15": "Joanna said:I can tell! Your cooking skills are awesome. Seen any good movies lately?",
    "D3:16": "Nate said:Not recently. Any good ones you'd recommend?",
    "D3:17": "Joanna said:I just watched \"Little Women\" and it was amazing! It's a great story about sisterhood, love, and reaching for your dreams. Definitely a must-see!",
    "D3:18": "Nate said:Oh, that sounds like a great one! I'll definitely add it to my list. Thanks for the recommendation!",
    "D3:19": "Joanna said:Anytime! I'm always down to give movie reccomendations.",
    "D3:20": "Nate said:Good to know! I'll be sure to give you a shout whenever I run out of things to watch!",
    "D3:21": "Joanna said:Sounds great! Let me know what you think of it when your done!",
    "D3:22": "Nate said:You bet! You'll be the first to know.",
    "D3:23": "Joanna said:Awesome! Enjoy yourself!",
    "D3:24": "Nate said:You too, take care!",
    "D3:25": "Joanna said:Later, take care!",
    "D4:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! Sorry I haven't been around. I made my friend some ice cream and they loved it!",
    "D4:2": "Joanna said:No worries, Nate! Glad to hear it. What flavor did you make?",
    "D4:3": "Nate said:I whipped up some chocolate and vanilla swirl.",
    "D4:4": "Joanna said:That looks delicious! Unfortunately, I can't have dairy, so no ice cream for me. Do you happen to have a dairy-free recipe that I could try?",
    "D4:5": "Nate said:Sure, I know one recipe using coconut milk. Would you like me to send it to you?",
    "D4:6": "Joanna said:Yeah, definitely! I'm keen to try your recipe. Always up for something sweet.",
    "D4:7": "Nate said:Cool, I'll do that. I'm all about these desserts, let me know what you think!",
    "D4:8": "Joanna said:Definitely keeping you posted! Love your creations!",
    "D4:9": "Nate said:Thanks, Joanna! It means a lot that you enjoy the desserts I bake.",
    "D4:10": "Joanna said:Yeah Nate, your cooking is amazing! I can't stop thinking about the screenplay, so I just started writing another one while I wait to hear back about how the first one did.",
    "D4:11": "Nate said:I hear that, taking your mind of something like that is very challenging. What's the new one about?",
    "D4:12": "Joanna said:It's about a thirty year old woman on a journey of self-discovery after a loss. Somewhat similar to the last one, but hey, that's just the kind of thing I'm inspired to write about!",
    "D4:13": "Nate said:Interesting! That's a deep topic. Love to hear more about it.",
    "D4:14": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! It's my own story. The main character is dealing with some tough stuff: loss and trying to figure out who they are. They take a road trip to heal and grow.",
    "D4:15": "Nate said:Wow, Joanna, that sounds awesome. I love stories that tackle important issues. What inspired you to this one?",
    "D4:16": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! It was inspired by personal experiences and my own journey of self-discovery.",
    "D4:17": "Nate said:Wow, Joanna, that takes guts! I can't wait to see it all come together. I'm also pumped to see how your first one will do!",
    "D4:18": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Appreciate your support. Hoping my screenplay gets noticed and makes it to the screen. Fingers crossed!",
    "D4:19": "Nate said:Crossing my fingers for you! Hope your screenplay finds a fan and is given its due. Good luck!",
    "D5:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, it's been a minute! I wrapped up my second script, and the feels have been wild. Sometimes I'm so relieved, but other times I just feel anxious about what comes next. It's a mix of excitement and terror, thinking about my work getting noticed and hitting the big screen.",
    "D5:2": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! Awesome to hear from you! Congrats on wrapping up a second one! All that hard work and dedication will definitely shine through and get noticed, no doubt. Hope you've been able to take some time to relax after everything!",
    "D5:3": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! It's been a wild ride. I've been decompressing, but it's hard to switch off. There's always this tug-of-war of hope and doubt.",
    "D5:4": "Nate said:It's normal to have doubts, but you've worked hard and put tons of passion into it. Believe in yourself and things will work out. Here, look at this cute pic - walking them always reminds me to enjoy the small stuff!",
    "D5:5": "Joanna said:That pic's adorable! They always look so relaxed outside. What made you choose them as pets?",
    "D5:6": "Nate said:I'm drawn to turtles. They're unique and their slow pace is a nice change from the rush of life. They're also low-maintenance and calming. Check out this moment I snapped!",
    "D5:7": "Joanna said:They look so peaceful! It's amazing how these creatures bring so much calm and joy. Is taking care of them tough?",
    "D5:8": "Nate said:No, not really. Just keep their area clean, feed them properly, and make sure they get enough light. It's actually kind of fun.",
    "D5:9": "Joanna said:Sounds great! Having pets must be a wonderful experience.",
    "D5:10": "Nate said:Pets definitely bring tons of joy. They are always there for us and they're so cute! Relaxing with them is a great way to chill.",
    "D5:11": "Joanna said:I wish I wasn't allergic! I would get two turtles today if I could! I found out recently I'm allergic to cockroaches as well, so who knows if I'll ever get a pet.",
    "D5:12": "Nate said:Sorry! Maybe there are other animals you could consider! In the meantime though, I'll be sure to send you pics of my turtles so you can still watch them grow without getting too close.",
    "D5:13": "Joanna said:Great idea! I'm already really invested in those little guys!",
    "D5:14": "Nate said:Pets really seem to do that to everyone don't they! So, what about your script now? Any ideas for the next steps?",
    "D5:15": "Joanna said:I've been doing my fair share of research and networking non-stop for it. It's tough, but I'm determined to make it happen.",
    "D5:16": "Nate said:Great idea! that should hopefully get some more eyes on it. Keep up the hard work!",
    "D5:17": "Joanna said:Thanks so much, Nate! Your support means a lot. I'll keep working at it and hopefully the next steps will become clearer soon.",
    "D5:18": "Nate said:Just make sure you don't quit - the path forward will show up soon. You got this!",
    "D5:19": "Joanna said:Appreciated! I think just having someone to support me throughout the whole process is such a blessing. It gives me the motivation to keep pushing forward.",
    "D5:20": "Nate said:Glad to hear my support makes a difference, Joanna. I'm here for you!",
    "D5:21": "Joanna said:Always good to hear! See you later!",
    "D6:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! Long time no talk, how's it going? Crazy stuff's been happening since we last chatted.",
    "D6:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Been quite a ride - in a good way - had an audition yesterday for a writing gig.",
    "D6:3": "Nate said:Congrats! How did it go? Are you excited?",
    "D6:4": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! It went alright. Mixed emotions - definitely excited but also a bit anxious. Keep those fingers crossed!",
    "D6:5": "Nate said:Yeah, I get it. Mixed emotions are rough, but I have faith in you! Keep me posted - you got this!",
    "D6:6": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Your support means a lot. I'll make sure to keep you updated. Anything new on your end?",
    "D6:7": "Nate said:Yeah actually - I'm currently participating in the video game tournament again and it's INTENSE! There's so much adrenaline flowing.",
    "D6:8": "Joanna said:Best of luck in the tournament! It sounds like it would be difficult to go through so many days of intense gaming! This is my go-to place for writing inspiration. It helps me stay sharp and motivated.",
    "D6:9": "Nate said:Wow, that's a lot of books. Do you have any advice for someone like me who wants to pursue writing?",
    "D6:10": "Joanna said:Definitely! Read lots and try out different genres. Build a solid understanding of literature. Don't be afraid to write and share, even if it's just with friends. Practicing and gathering feedback will make you better. Have faith in yourself and continue following your writing dreams - it's tough but worth it.",
    "D6:11": "Nate said:Thanks, Joanna. Really appreciate your help and kind words. I'm going to keep working hard on it and see what happens. Good luck with your project, I'm sure it will turn out great!",
    "D6:12": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! Appreciate your kind words and support. Let's keep going for our dreams and work hard. Catch you later!",
    "D6:13": "Nate said:Bye Joanna! Take care!",
    "D7:1": "Nate said:Hey Jo, guess what I did? Dyed my hair last week - come see!",
    "D7:2": "Joanna said:Wow, Nate! Can't wait to see it. Must feel so liberating! How're you feeling?",
    "D7:3": "Nate said:I'm so stoked about it! Check it out!",
    "D7:4": "Joanna said:Wow, your new hair color looks amazing! What made you choose that shade? Tell me all about it!",
    "D7:5": "Nate said:Thanks Jo! I picked this color because it's bright and bold - like me! I wanted to stand out from the regular options.",
    "D7:6": "Joanna said:That's amazing, Nate! Your boldness really inspired me. It reminded me of this gorgeous sunset I saw while hiking the other day. It made me realize the importance of showing the world who we are.",
    "D7:7": "Nate said:Wow, that sunset looks awesome! Jealous! I bet you had a great time. Are there any more exciting trips coming up for you?",
    "D7:8": "Joanna said:I did! the sky was so gorgeous! Wish I had a vacation lined up, but right now my writing is consuming me. Hoping for some good news soon!",
    "D7:9": "Nate said:I understand, Joanna. Big projects can be so taxing. Keep me posted on how it goes, alright?",
    "D7:10": "Joanna said:Cheers, Nate! Your support means a lot. I'll definitely keep you updated.",
    "D7:11": "Nate said:Sounds great, See you soon?",
    "D7:12": "Joanna said:Totally! Bye Nate!",
    "D7:13": "Nate said:Take care!",
    "D8:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! Haven't talked with you in a while - how's it going?",
    "D8:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Great to hear from you. I've been reading a lot in the past week! There's a lot of good books I forgot I owned.",
    "D8:3": "Nate said:Sounds fun! I probably also have loads of books I haven't read in years. Sounds like a blast from the past!",
    "D8:4": "Joanna said:It really is! On a different note, I found an awesome hiking trail in my hometown yesterday! It was gorgeous. Nature is so inspiring, and it's a great way to reset. Do you know of any good hiking spots?",
    "D8:5": "Nate said:I'm not really into hiking but I'm curious to see what the trail looks like! I heard there's a nice trail just north of where I live.",
    "D8:6": "Joanna said:Maybe I'll have to convince you to go with me one of these times!",
    "D8:7": "Nate said:Maybe! I do like nature, so that might be fun going with someone else.",
    "D8:8": "Joanna said:Yeah, nature's awesome! I'm a huge fan of it, that's why I go!",
    "D8:9": "Nate said:Agreed, nature has a way of being so inspiring! I'm glad you found a way to reset and find peace in it.",
    "D8:10": "Joanna said:Nature's always been my haven. Walking in it, feeling it, hearing the sounds - it's so calming. Worries and stress seem to vanish, and it's just me and the beauty around me.",
    "D8:11": "Nate said:It's so crucial to find a little peace and remember life's beauty. For me, it's spending time with my pets and engaging in my hobbies; they let me take a break from reality. It's wild how small things can have such a powerful effect on our happiness, right?",
    "D8:12": "Joanna said:Yeah, Nate! Even the small things make life enjoyable and worth it. Taking time for your little friends and doing activities you love are like treasures that remind us how great and peaceful life is. We just gotta savor them!",
    "D8:13": "Nate said:Speaking of which, here they go again!",
    "D8:14": "Joanna said:So cute! I love your turtles so much!",
    "D8:15": "Nate said:Me too! I love watching them play to simply enjoy the peaceful moments of life. Sometimes I even bring them in the kitchen so they can watch me make food like this!",
    "D8:16": "Joanna said:I love your icecream so much! I wish I could make it the way you do!",
    "D8:17": "Nate said:Thanks! It's dairy-free and so easy. Wanna get the recipe?",
    "D8:18": "Joanna said:Sure! I'm lactose intolerant, so I'll just need the dairy-free recipe! ",
    "D8:19": "Nate said:No prob. I made it with coconut milk, vanilla extract, sugar, and a pinch of salt. After chilling it in the fridge, I put it in the ice cream maker and froze it until it was scoopable.",
    "D8:20": "Joanna said:Wow, sounds delicious! I'm going to try making it tonight! Thank you for sharing the recipe!",
    "D8:21": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, glad I could help. Let me know how it turns out!",
    "D8:22": "Joanna said:Got it, Nate. I'll definitely let you know how it turns out. Thanks for sharing the recipe!",
    "D9:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Long time no talk! I wanted to tell ya I just joined a writers group. It's unbelievable--such inspirational people who really get my writing. I'm feeling so motivated and supported, it's like I finally belong somewhere!",
    "D9:2": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! That's awesome! Having a supportive group around you can really make a difference. What kind of projects are you working on with them?",
    "D9:3": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! We've made some great progress. I'm working on one with my group called \"Finding Home.\" It's a script about a girl on a journey to find her true home. I find it really rewarding and emotional. What about you? Any upcoming gaming tournaments?",
    "D9:4": "Nate said:Hi Joanna! \"Finding Home\" sounds really special. Must be so meaningful to work on. I've got a gaming tournament next month and I'm feeling good about it. It's gonna be my 4th one!",
    "D9:5": "Joanna said:Yeah, I bet the nerves and excitement are quite a rush! I remember when I did my first play, I was so nervous I forgot my lines. It was embarrassing, but it taught me how important it is to prepare and stay in the moment.",
    "D9:6": "Nate said:Sounds like you had an interesting time on stage! It's always a learning experience. Have you ever considered going back to acting? Is that you in the photo?",
    "D9:7": "Joanna said:Yeah, that's me in that photo! Acting was my first passion, but now I really shine in writing. It helps me express myself in a new way, but who knows, maybe I'll go back to acting someday. Never say never!",
    "D9:8": "Nate said:Go for it! Follow your passion for writing, but if acting really makes you happy, give it a shot as well. Who knows what'll happen! Any particular movies that spark your writing?",
    "D9:9": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! I'm gonna keep writing, but if acting calls out I might give it a try. I really enjoy dramas and emotionally-driven films. What about you? What inspires your passion?",
    "D9:10": "Nate said:I love fantasy and sci-fi movies, they're a great escape and get my imagination going. Playing video games is a great way to express my creativity and passion.",
    "D9:11": "Joanna said:That's awesome! I love how video games can really spark your imagination. Do you have a favorite fantasy or sci-fi movie?",
    "D9:12": "Nate said:Yeah, for sure! This trilogy is one of my faves. The world building, battles, and storytelling always blow me away!",
    "D9:13": "Joanna said:Wow, that's great to hear! What books do you enjoy? I'm always up for some new book recommendations.",
    "D9:14": "Nate said:I love this series. It has adventures, magic, and great characters - it's a must-read!",
    "D9:15": "Joanna said:Heard of that series! It's been on my list forever. Thanks for the recommendation, Nate. I'm definitely going to check it out!",
    "D9:16": "Nate said:No problem, glad to see an interest. Let me know what you think when you check it out.",
    "D9:17": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! I'll definitely let you know my thoughts. Take care and have a great day!",
    "D9:18": "Nate said:See you! Good chatting with you! Have a great day!",
    "D10:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, how's it going? I took your reccomendation and watched \"The Lord of the Rings\" Trilogy last night! It was awesome!",
    "D10:2": "Nate said:Glad to hear you enjoyed it! It's probably the greatest trilogy of all time! As for me, life's been ok, just taking care of this.",
    "D10:3": "Joanna said:Wow, Nate! I'm proud of what you did. Your gaming room looks great - have you been gaming a lot recently?",
    "D10:4": "Nate said:Gaming has been my focus - practicing a lot and even winning a few tournaments. Last week I won my second tournament!",
    "D10:5": "Joanna said:Wow, congrats! What game were you playing?",
    "D10:6": "Nate said:Thanks! I usually play CS:GO, but I tried my hand at the local Street Fighter tournament this time since I play that game a lot with my friends, and turns out I'm really good!",
    "D10:7": "Joanna said:Nice! That must have been a surprise. How did it feel to finally win one?",
    "D10:8": "Nate said:It was super awesome! So much adrenaline went into that last match, and the other finalist even shook my hand! Enough about me though, how about you? What have you been up to?",
    "D10:9": "Joanna said:Not much is new other than the screenplay. Been working on some projects and testing out dairy-free dessert recipes for friends and fam. Here's a pic of a cake I made recently!",
    "D10:10": "Nate said:That looks really good! I love the way the frosting turned out!",
    "D10:11": "Joanna said:Thanks! It's dairy-free vanilla with strawberry filling and coconut cream frosting. I gotta say, I really like your coconut reccomendation you gave a while back!",
    "D10:12": "Nate said:Wow, Joanna, that looks amazing! I bet it tastes great - you're so talented at making dairy-free desserts!",
    "D10:13": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! I really appreciate it. I love experimenting in the kitchen, coming up with something tasty. Cooking and baking are my creative outlets. Especially when I'm snackin' dairy-free, trying to make the desserts just as delicious - it's a rewarding challenge! Seeing the smiles on everyone's faces when they try it - it's a total win!",
    "D10:14": "Nate said:That's great, Joanna! It must be so rewarding to see everyone enjoying your creations. Keep up the good work!",
    "D10:15": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Appreciate all the help. Gonna keep trying new things. See ya later!",
    "D10:16": "Nate said:Bye!",
    "D11:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Great to hear from you! Quite a week since we last talked - something awesome happened to me!",
    "D11:2": "Nate said:Hey Jo! Great hearing from you! What happened?",
    "D11:3": "Joanna said:I went hiking and found some more amazing trails in my town. It was such an awesome experience! I think I am an expert hiker now.",
    "D11:4": "Nate said:Sounds great, Jo! Happy you had an awesome experience. Did you happen to take any photos of it?",
    "D11:5": "Joanna said:Yeah, I did! Loved this spot on the hike. The rush of the water was so soothing.",
    "D11:6": "Nate said:Wow, looks great! Where did you take this picture? I love the dark sky and green scenery.",
    "D11:7": "Joanna said:Thanks! I took this photo at a beautiful location called Whispering Falls. It was really peaceful and serene.",
    "D11:8": "Nate said:I wish I could have been there! Your hikes sound like a blast.",
    "D11:9": "Joanna said:It was awesome, Nate. The sound of that place and the beauty of nature made me so calm and peaceful. Everything else faded away and all that mattered was the present.",
    "D11:10": "Nate said:That's great. Glad you found a spot that calms you down - nature sure can be a break from the craziness.",
    "D11:11": "Joanna said:Nature totally inspires me and it's so calming to be surrounded by its beauty. Hiking has opened up a whole new world for me and I feel like a different person now.",
    "D11:12": "Nate said:Wow, Jo, that's really cool! It's great to have something that gets those creative juices flowing.",
    "D11:13": "Joanna said:I always feel like I could write a whole movie when I'm out there in cool places like that!",
    "D11:14": "Nate said:Wow! That's really cool that it inspires you that much! For me I just get deep in thought and think about my life or new recipes.",
    "D11:15": "Joanna said:I think about my life too sometimes when I'm out and about, but there was something special about these trails that made me feel like writing a drama.",
    "D11:16": "Nate said:Hey, we should go together sometime, don't you think? Maybe I'll start to think of a drama myself and publish my own screenplay.",
    "D11:17": "Joanna said:Haha, now that would be something! Sure, you should come down and join me on the trails sometime!",
    "D11:18": "Nate said:Sounds like a plan! Thanks for the invite Joanna!",
    "D11:19": "Joanna said:Sure thing Nate! See you later!",
    "D11:20": "Nate said:See ya!",
    "D12:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! How've you been? Been a busy week since we talked.",
    "D12:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Just finished something - pretty wild journey!",
    "D12:3": "Nate said:Way to go! I just got a new addition to the family, this is Max!",
    "D12:4": "Joanna said:Wow, he's adorable! How long have you had him? I can see why you're thrilled!",
    "D12:5": "Nate said:Thanks! It's awesome - he's adopted and so full of energy, and he's filling my life with so much joy. He's even keeping my other pets active.",
    "D12:6": "Joanna said:Pets sure do make life better! Glad Max is bringing you lots of joy.",
    "D12:7": "Nate said:Yep, totally! Pets make us so much happier and never let us down. Have you thought any more of getting one of your own?",
    "D12:8": "Joanna said:Unfortunately, allergies make it so I don't really want to get any, and I'm too lazy to research alternative pets for my allergies.",
    "D12:9": "Nate said:Aww, that's unfortunate. It's nice seeing the joy pets bring to others, though. How do you find comfort when you don't have any?",
    "D12:10": "Joanna said:Writing and creative projects are what get me through tough times. I'm also grateful for my supportive friends.",
    "D12:11": "Nate said:Wow, that's awesome! Those both can definitely be therapeutic. It's great to have such positive relationships that make such a great impact.",
    "D12:12": "Joanna said:Yeah. It's so nice to have friends who understand and appreciate my work - it's priceless being able to talk about it together and receive feedback. Here's a look at what I've been working on – it's been quite a journey, but I made it!",
    "D12:13": "Nate said:Wow, that looks great Joanna! Is that your third one?",
    "D12:14": "Joanna said:Yep! I chose to write about this because it's really personal. It's about loss, identity, and connection. It's a story I've had for ages but just got the guts to write it. It was hard, but I'm so proud of it.",
    "D12:15": "Nate said:That sounds impressive. You really do like writing about sadness and loss don't you.",
    "D12:16": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Yeah I really do. I had to be vulnerable and dig deep into those topics. But I think meaningful stories come from personal experiences and feelings. It was scary, but I found that I write best when I'm being true to myself - even if it's hard.",
    "D12:17": "Nate said:Well done, Joanna! It takes guts to explore your experiences and feelings. I'm proud of you for staying strong and being true to yourself. Keep it up!",
    "D12:18": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Your support really means a lot. Knowing I've got people like you cheering me on makes this journey way easier.",
    "D12:19": "Nate said:No worries, Joanna! Keep going and reach for your dreams. You've got tons of talent and potential!",
    "D13:1": "Nate said:Hey Jo! Been ages since we last talked. Here's something cool that happened the other day - I took Max for a walk and ran into this super nice couple who had a dog. It turns out they live close by. We decided to do doggy playdates, which is awesome considering we all need friends for our pets.",
    "D13:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Great to hear from you. Sounds like a nice encounter on your walk. Connecting with others who have pets can be uplifting and rewarding.",
    "D13:3": "Nate said:It's like fate. Having a walking buddy forMax will be great. He really likes the other dog too!",
    "D13:4": "Joanna said:Awesome! Did you get to know the couple very well? What were they like?",
    "D13:5": "Nate said:They actually didn't share a whole lot in common with me besides the love of animals, but I think that was all we needed to share in common to be good friends!",
    "D13:6": "Joanna said:That's really cool that you can just go out and meet people like that, keep it up Nate!",
    "D13:7": "Nate said:Thanks! I just really enjoy watching our pets play with one another. Its like a dream come true seeing my dog so happy.",
    "D13:8": "Joanna said:I can see why having a peaceful presence around could help relieve stress. Having someone or something to come home to for a sense of calm would be helpful for relaxation.",
    "D13:9": "Nate said:Yep, Joanna. It's great! Looky here, I got this new pup for you!",
    "D13:10": "Joanna said:Awww! It's so cute! I love the thought Nate!",
    "D13:11": "Nate said:Thanks! It's a stuffed animal to remind you of the good vibes.",
    "D13:12": "Joanna said:That's so sweet! I'll cherish that little guy with all my heart!",
    "D13:13": "Nate said:Yeah! It's like having joy in your pocket. It always makes me grin when I look at it.",
    "D13:14": "Joanna said:That's great, Nate! Appreciate the small joys like that cute stuffed animal. It's a nice reminder!",
    "D13:15": "Nate said:Agreed, those little things sure do make life better!",
    "D13:16": "Joanna said:I'll always remember those moments that bring us happiness and remind us that life is great!",
    "D13:17": "Nate said:Sure, Joanna! It's all about finding those little things and cherishing them, otherwise it's easy to get down!",
    "D13:18": "Joanna said:Thinking back to the tough times finishing my screenplay made me realize it's those moments that bring joy and make the journey worth it.",
    "D13:19": "Nate said:Yeah, those little moments make it all worth it, especially during tough times. Enjoying the ride is key.",
    "D13:20": "Joanna said:Appreciating the journey and being aware of those happy moments can be a game-changer! It keeps us focused on our dreams. Can't wait to show it to you. I value your opinion!",
    "D13:21": "Nate said:Can't wait to see it, Joanna! I'm here to support you.",
    "D13:22": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Your support is greatly appreciated. I'll make sure to keep you updated.",
    "D13:23": "Nate said:No worries! You've got this. Keep it up!",
    "D14:1": "Joanna said:Nate, after finishing my screenplay I got a rejection letter from a major company. It really bummed me out.",
    "D14:2": "Nate said:Sorry to hear that, Joanna. Rejection stinks, but it doesn't mean you're not talented. Don't give up on your dreams!",
    "D14:3": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate. It can feel like a step back sometimes. But I appreciate your kind words and encouragement.",
    "D14:4": "Nate said:Sure, just make sure you keep going and believing in yourself. Did something happen with the company?",
    "D14:5": "Joanna said:They just sent me a generic rejection letter without much feedback. It's disheartening not knowing why it didn't work out.",
    "D14:6": "Nate said:Ugh, that's so frustrating. But don't get discouraged, just keep going.",
    "D14:7": "Joanna said:Yeah, you're right. I won't let this bring me down. Thanks for your support. What have you been up to lately?",
    "D14:8": "Nate said:I've been doing great - I just won another regional video game tournament last week! It was so cool, plus I met some new people. Connecting with fellow gamers is always awesome.",
    "D14:9": "Joanna said:Way to go, Nate! Congratulations on your victory in the tournament! It must feel great to be recognized for your gaming skills.",
    "D14:10": "Nate said:Thanks, Joanna! Winning was a huge confidence boost and shows my hard work paid off. I'm really happy with my progress.",
    "D14:11": "Joanna said:I am as well! It's great to hear from you about your tournaments throughout the years!",
    "D14:12": "Nate said:Thanks! I has been a while since my first tournament hasn't it? I appreciate your support!",
    "D14:13": "Joanna said:Anytime Nate! I'm here for you every step of the way.",
    "D14:14": "Nate said:I talked to some of the guys at the tournament afterwards, and they said they wanted to hang out later!",
    "D14:15": "Joanna said:Sounds like fun! It's good to have friends that share your interests!",
    "D14:16": "Nate said:For sure! They asked for some tips in how to improve their game, so I said I could help.",
    "D14:17": "Joanna said:Good on you for helping strangers out! Stepping outside your comfort zone is always great.",
    "D14:18": "Nate said:Thanks, I just like helping people. Do you have any plans for the weekend?",
    "D14:19": "Joanna said:Yep, I'm hiking with some buddies this weekend. We're checking out a new trail with a rad waterfall. Can't wait! Do you have any fun plans?",
    "D14:20": "Nate said:Sounds great! Have fun with that. I'm organizing a gaming party two weekends later - it'll be hectic but fun!",
    "D14:21": "Joanna said:Oh? Are you going to invite your tournament friends?",
    "D14:22": "Nate said:Definitely! And some old friends and teamates from other tournaments.",
    "D14:23": "Joanna said:Sounds like fun, Nate! I wish you the best on your party. Have a blast!",
    "D14:24": "Nate said:Thanks Joanna! I'm sure it'll be a blast. I'm even getting everyone custom controller decorations just for coming!",
    "D14:25": "Joanna said:Wow, I bet they'll love that! What a sweet idea.",
    "D14:26": "Nate said:I know right? Have a great hike. Take lots of pics! See ya later!",
    "D14:27": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! See you later!",
    "D15:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Yesterday was crazy cool - I wrote a few bits for a screenplay that appeared on the big screen yesterday! It was nerve-wracking but so inspiring to see my words come alive!",
    "D15:2": "Nate said:Congrats, Joanna! Seeing your hard work pay off like that must've felt amazing. I bet it was scary too, but awesome! You're so inspiring. By the way, last time we saw eachother, I noticed a spiderman pin on your purse. Is Spider-Man your favorite superhero, or do you have another fave?",
    "D15:3": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! It was a real roller coaster, but seeing the hard work pay off was amazing. Spider-Man has always been a favorite of mine - I mean, who doesn't love Peter Parker's struggles between being a hero and being a person? But I'm kind of a sucker for any superhero - everyone has their own rad story and powers. Do you have a favorite superhero?",
    "D15:4": "Nate said:That's great, Joanna! Iron Man is my top pick. I love his tech and that sarcastic humor. Seeing these figures just makes me feel invincible!",
    "D15:5": "Joanna said:Wow, Nate! That's awesome. I love the tech and funny jokes of Iron Man too. What made you get that figure?",
    "D15:6": "Nate said:Thanks Joanna! I got it because it reminded me of something I love. Its presence in my room is a good reminder to keep working on my goals. Any inspiring things in your room?",
    "D15:7": "Joanna said:My cork board is full of inspiring quotes and pictures for motivation and creativity. It's my little corner of inspiration.",
    "D15:8": "Nate said:Wow Joanna, that sounds great! Could you show me a picture of it?",
    "D15:9": "Joanna said:Here ya go, a pic of my cork board. It's got quotes, photos, and little keepsakes.",
    "D15:10": "Nate said:That's a great pic of your family! What made you hang it on your cork board?",
    "D15:11": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Having that picture on my cork board reminds me of the love and encouragement from them every day.",
    "D15:12": "Nate said:That's great, Joanna. Family support is invaluable. It's so good to have those reminders.",
    "D15:13": "Joanna said:Absolutely, it means a lot and keeps me going.",
    "D15:14": "Nate said:I really should start a cork board of my own shouldn't I. That seems like a really valuable thing!",
    "D15:15": "Joanna said:I would definitely recommend it! As long as your willing to explain what it is to your friends.",
    "D15:16": "Nate said:Of course! Well see you later Joanna!",
    "D15:17": "Joanna said:Bye Nate!",
    "D16:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, long time no see! How have you been? I just got done submitting my recent screenplay to a film contest just to see how others might like it!",
    "D16:2": "Nate said:That's really cool Joanna! I hope it does well, and I've been doing great! The gaming party was a great success! We even played some Chess afterward just for fun.",
    "D16:3": "Joanna said:Nice! Did your friends like the controller accessories?",
    "D16:4": "Nate said:Most of them did! I can't say if all of them will continue to use them or not, but that's beside the point.",
    "D16:5": "Joanna said:Yeah Nate, you're right. It doesn't matter if they use it, its the thought that matters right?",
    "D16:6": "Nate said:Absolutely! There were 7 people that attended, and 6 of them said they'd want to do it again next month!",
    "D16:7": "Joanna said:That sounds like a huge success then! Congrats!",
    "D16:8": "Nate said:Thanks! On another note, I made vegan ice cream last Friday and shared it with some people in my vegan diet group. It was awesome!",
    "D16:9": "Joanna said:Mm, yum! Can you give me the recipe for that? It sounds like it'd be a good recipe!",
    "D16:10": "Nate said:Sure thing! I can give it to you tomorrow, how does that sound?",
    "D16:11": "Joanna said:Awesome! I'm going to make it for my family this weekend - can't wait!",
    "D16:12": "Nate said:Nice one, Joanna! Hope you and your family like it. Let me know how it went!",
    "D16:13": "Joanna said:Sure thing! They love it when I make them new things!",
    "D16:14": "Nate said:Then I have no doubt they'll love the icecream!",
    "D16:15": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! Your support is greatly appreciated. I'll make sure to keep you updated.",
    "D16:16": "Nate said:Can't wait to hear about it. Have a great day! Take care.",
    "D17:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, check this out! I won my fourth video game tournament on Friday! It was awesome competing and showing off my skills - and the victory was indescribable. I'm really proud that I can make money doing what I love. This one was online!",
    "D17:2": "Joanna said:Congrats, Nate! That's awesome! So proud of you. Your hard work really paid off - keep it up! BTW, I took a road trip for research for my next movie while you were winning. Much-needed break and a chance to explore new places and get inspired.",
    "D17:3": "Nate said:Thanks, Joanna! Your support means a lot to me. That road trip sounds great! Where did you go? Did you discover any interesting places?",
    "D17:4": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! Appreciate your kind words. I went to Woodhaven, a small town in the Midwest. Got to see some lovely scenery and historic buildings. Checked out the library there, it had a cool old book collection!",
    "D17:5": "Nate said:That place looks interesting! Did you find any cool books there?",
    "D17:6": "Joanna said:I stumbled upon this super cool book from the 1900s with stories and sketches - so awesome to read about the town and the people living there!",
    "D17:7": "Nate said:That sounds really interesting! Anyting specific stick out to you about it?",
    "D17:8": "Joanna said:Woodhaven has had an interesting past with lots of cool people. Seeing how much it changed sparked ideas for my next script.",
    "D17:9": "Nate said:Real-life stories are the best for inspiration. Can't wait to hear about your next one. Keep it up!",
    "D17:10": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! I'm stoked about this new script. It's different from my previous work, but it has the potential to be something awesome! I'll be sure to keep you posted.",
    "D17:11": "Nate said:I'm sure it will do just as well as your last one! Keep on trying and believe in yourself!",
    "D17:12": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Your encouragement really means a lot to me. You're the best for supporting me in my writing journey.",
    "D17:13": "Nate said:I'm always here for you! You've got so much talent, just keep going for it!",
    "D17:14": "Joanna said:I will! I actually started on a book recently since my movie did well!",
    "D17:15": "Nate said:Nice! I'm curious, what is it about?",
    "D17:16": "Joanna said:That page specifically has some dialogues exploring loss, redemption, and forgiveness. It's a deep and emotional story that I'm really excited about!",
    "D17:17": "Nate said:Wow, Joanna! It sounds awesome. I'm so excited to see how it all plays out!",
    "D17:18": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! I'm so glad you're excited. I've never really tried publishing a book, but this might be the first!",
    "D17:19": "Nate said:Good luck on that! I'm sure people will recognise you as the same author of the movie you got published and love the book even more.",
    "D17:20": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Your belief in me means a lot. I'll keep doing my best. Thanks for the support!",

    "D18:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, long time no talk! I've been busy with writing projects and really going all out with it. It's been the best thing ever - a mix of highs and lows - and my journal's pretty much my rock. Writing's such a huge part of me now.",
    "D18:2": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! Great to hear it! It's amazing how much a certain activity can become a part of our lives. Keep it up, you're inspiring! Is writing your way to solace and creativity?",
    "D18:3": "Joanna said:Yeah, definitely. Writing has become like an escape and a way to express my feelings. It gives me a chance to put all my thoughts and feelings down and make something good out of it. Words just have a magical way of healing.",
    "D18:4": "Nate said:That's really cool, I like it! It's incredible how words can turn something sad into something special. I'm glad it worked for you. Anything cool happening recently?",
    "D18:5": "Joanna said:Yep. Last week, someone wrote me a letter after reading an online blog post I made about a hard moment in my life. Their words touched me; they said my story had brought them comfort. It was awesome to realize my words had that kind of power. It reminded me why I love writing.",
    "D18:6": "Nate said:Nice work, Joanna! That must feel sureal. Keep it up - you're changing lives!",
    "D18:7": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Really appreciate your kind words. It's knowing that my writing can make a difference that keeps me going, even on tough days. So glad to have this outlet to share my stories and hopefully have an impact. How about you? Anything new since we last talked?",
    "D18:8": "Nate said:Thanks, Joanna! Your words mean a lot. Since we last spoke, I started teaching people how to make this. Sharing my love for dairy-free desserts has been fun and rewarding.",
    "D18:9": "Joanna said:Yum, Nate! I love it when you make coconut milk icecream, it's so good!",
    "D18:10": "Nate said:I've been really into making this lately - it's creamy, rich, dairy-free and a new recipe! Wanna try it? I can share the recipe with you if you'd like!",

    "D19:5": "Nate said:They're my little buddies, always calm and peaceful. It makes coming home after a long day of gaming better. The tank expansion has made them so happy! How have you been?",
    "D19:6": "Joanna said:I'm good! Was super nervous last week when I shared my book with my writers group but got some great feedback. My hard work is paying off, it's such an awesome feeling!",

    "D19:12": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! I've learned that taking breaks and looking after myself are important for my inspiration and mental health. It's all about finding balance.",
    "D19:13": "Nate said:Yeah, balance is key! It's so cool how taking care of ourselves helps us be more creative and happier. I'm always looking for something new to read. Got any book recommendations? I've got a lot of books to choose from.",
    "D19:14": "Joanna said:I reccomend finding a fantasy book series to read through. Most fiction series are great reads when your trying to relax.",
    "D19:15": "Nate said:Good idea! How about this series?",
    "D19:16": "Joanna said:That's a great one! Let me know what you think when your finished!",

    "D20:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! Long time no talk. So much has happened. Look how cute they are! Hanging with them has been a big help, especially recently. Speaking of which, I just had a letdown in a video game tourney - I didn't do too great, even though I tried. It was a setback, but I'm trying to stay positive.",
    "D20:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Cute turtles! Bummer about the setback. Any positive vibes comin' your way? I just revised on of my old recipes and made this!",
    "D20:3": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, yeah it's a bummer that I didn't do well. But it's all part of the learning curve, you know? Also that looks super good! Anyways, how are you holding up?",
    "D20:4": "Joanna said:I'm doing OK, thanks. Just been tinkering with that recipe and a few others. It's helping me find some comfort and getting creative.",
    "D20:5": "Nate said:What else are you making? It's always satisfying to see the kind of things you do when your in one of those moods!",
    "D20:6": "Joanna said:Been tweaking a dessert recipe to make it yummier and more accessible.",
    "D20:7": "Nate said:Wow, that sounds great! What flavors are you experimenting with?",
    "D20:8": "Joanna said:Trying out different flavors like chocolate, raspberry, and coconut has been a blast!",
    "D20:9": "Nate said:Sounds delicious! Are you only trying dairy-free options?",
    "D20:10": "Joanna said:Yeah, since I'm lactose intolerant I'm trying out dairy-free options like coconut or almond milk instead. It's been a fun challenge seeing how to make yummy treats that suit everyone's diets. I even made these dairy-free chocolate coconut cupcakes with raspberry frosting.",
    "D20:11": "Nate said:Woah, those look great, Joanna! It's cool that you make desserts that work for everyone's diets. Do you have any more yummy recipes hiding in there?",
    "D20:12": "Joanna said:Yep! I've been making all sorts of desserts that work for everyone's diets - cookies, pies, cakes - everything! I'll share more recipes with you soon.",
    "D20:13": "Nate said:Can't wait to try them. Can I join you sometime? I think baking and cooking really brings us together!",
    "D20:14": "Joanna said:Yeah, Nate! A fellow Chef in the kitchen is always a great help! Speaking of which, i'm curious, any more tips for dairy-free baking?",
    "D20:15": "Nate said:You can use stuff like dairy-free margarine or coconut oil instead of butter, and make sure to check the labels to ensure they're dairy-free. Good luck!",
    "D20:16": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Love your ideas, can't wait to try them out!",
    "D20:17": "Nate said:No problem! I love to help, so just shoot me a question anytime you need!",
    "D20:18": "Joanna said:Got it Nate, I'll see you soon!",
    "D20:19": "Nate said:Bye Joanna! Good luck!",
    "D21:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, long time no see! My laptop crashed last week and I lost all my work - super frustrating! As a writer, my laptop is like half of my lifeline so losing all progress was like a major blow.",
    "D21:2": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, sorry to hear about that. Losing so much progress must be really frustrating. Did you manage to recover anything? Maybe consider backing up your work in the future?",
    "D21:3": "Joanna said:Thanks for the sympathy, Nate. Nothing was recoverable, but now I have an external drive for backups. I never want to go through this again. So, how have you been? Making anything cool?",
    "D21:4": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, I'm no writer like you, but something pretty awesome happened. Last Monday I got to teach people vegan ice cream recipes on my own cooking show! It was a bit nerve-wracking to put myself out there, but it was a blast. Plus, I picked up a few new recipes!",
    "D21:5": "Joanna said:Way to go, Nate! Congrats on the cooking show, I'll definitely be tuning in! What's your favorite dish from the show?",
    "D21:6": "Nate said:Coconut milk ice cream is at the top of my list. It's so smooth and creamy with a tropical coconut twist. Plus, it's dairy-free for people who can't have lactose or who want vegan options. Here's a snap of the ice cream I made.",
    "D21:7": "Joanna said:Wow, that looks amazing, Nate! I love the color and texture. It's great that you're making these options. Could you share the recipe? I'd love to try making it sometime!",
    "D21:8": "Nate said:Yeah sure! Would love to share it. Let's spread the joy of dairy-free options! Let me know when you make it!",
    "D21:9": "Joanna said:Cool, Nate! Gonna give it a go. Dairy-free is a must for me, especially for desserts. Last Friday, I made a deeeelish dessert with almond milk - it was good! Got any favs when it comes to dairy-free desserts?",
    "D21:10": "Nate said:Coconut milk ice cream is one of my favorites as you might be able to tell, but I also love a dairy-free chocolate mousse. It's super creamy and tastes like the real thing. What's been your favorite dairy-free sweet treat so far?",
    "D21:11": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, my favorite dairy-free treat is this amazing chocolate raspberry tart. It has an almond flour crust, chocolate ganache, and fresh raspberries - it's delicious!",
    "D21:12": "Nate said:That looks amazing, Joanna! I need to try baking that. What other treats do you like making?",
    "D21:13": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, I love making this dairy-free chocolate cake with raspberries. It's so moist and delicious - perfect sweetness level.",
    "D21:14": "Nate said:That cake looks amazing, Joanna! How did you make it?",
    "D21:15": "Joanna said:I make it with almond flour, coconut oil, chocolate and raspberries. It's my favorite for birthdays and special days.",
    "D21:16": "Nate said:Yum, Joanna! Gotta try that one. Any others you want to share?",
    "D21:17": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Here's another recipe I like. It's a delicious dessert made with blueberries, coconut milk, and a gluten-free crust. So creamy and delicious!",
    "D21:18": "Nate said:Wow, Joanna! That dessert looks amazing. I'll definitely have to give it a try. Thanks!",
    "D21:19": "Joanna said:Glad to help, Nate. Let me know if you try it. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. It was great chatting.",
    "D21:20": "Nate said:Thanks Joanna! I will. Bye!",
    "D22:1": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, hi! Yesterday, I tried my newest dairy-free recipe and it was a winner with my family! Mixing and matching flavors is fun and I'm always trying new things. How about you?",
    "D22:2": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! That tart looks yummy! Lately, I've been doing great - I won a really big video game tournament last week and it was awesome! I still can't believe I made so much money from it.",
    "D22:3": "Joanna said:Way to go, Nate! Winning the tournament and earning cash is awesome - congrats! Did you save it for something special?",
    "D22:4": "Nate said:Thanks Joanna! Yeah, I saved some but I'm not sure what to do with it - I'm completely content already. I don't have big plans anyway, so it's nice to have the extra cash on hand.",
    "D22:5": "Joanna said:That's awesome, Nate! Having some extra cash on hand definitely brings a sense of freedom and relaxation, huh?",
    "D22:6": "Nate said:Yes! Finally, I don't have to stress about it, so I can just enjoy my movies and games.",
    "D22:7": "Joanna said:Taking breaks and reducing stress is pretty nice! Have you watched any good movies recently? I could use some recommendations!",
    "D22:8": "Nate said:I watched \"Little Women\" recently, and it was great! The acting was awesome and the story was so captivating. Definitely a good one!",
    "D22:9": "Joanna said:I'm so glad you enjoyed it! I recommended it to you a while back. I watched it too and it really spoke to me. Themes like sisterhood, love, and chasing dreams were explored so well. By the way, I finished up my writing for my book last week. Put in a ton of late nights and edits but finally got it done. I'm so proud of it! Can't wait to see what happens next.",
    "D22:10": "Nate said:Way to go! We both know it took some effort, but I'm sure it'll be great. Congrats on finishing it up!",
    "D22:11": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! Your words mean a lot. Dedication and late nights got me here, but it was worth it. Just like you with your recent tournament - hard work pays off. I appreciate your support throughout!",
    "D22:12": "Nate said:I'm always here for you, Joanna! You've worked so hard and accomplished a lot – I'm proud. Keep on going!",
    "D22:13": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! I won't give up on my goals as long as your here to support me.",
    "D22:14": "Nate said:You can always count on me! I even made this for you!",
    "D22:15": "Joanna said:Wow, Nate, that looks awesome! What inspired you?",
    "D22:16": "Nate said:I figured you could always look back on this whenever you need encouragement, and that was all the inspiration I needed. And I would also say that your life path can be quite inspirational!",
    "D22:17": "Joanna said:Wow, Nate! That's sweet of you! I'll make sure to remember this when I need the encouragement the most.",
    "D22:18": "Nate said:Awesome! I know encouragement is what got me so far in my gameing career, so I figured why not share the love.",
    "D22:19": "Joanna said:Rest assured, it will be something I cherish! On another note, I just finished this cute little bookmark for one of the ladies at my writing club!",
    "D22:20": "Nate said:That bookmark is great. I'm sure she'll love it!",
    "D22:21": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! I absolutley love DIYs, and I know she does too.",
    "D22:22": "Nate said:Let me know how it goes!",
    "D22:23": "Joanna said:Sure thing! Bye for now!",
    "D23:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, it's been a couple days since we last talked. Something exciting happened last Friday. I went to a game convention and met new people who weren't from my normal circle. It was a bit overwhelming but it reminded me of the good times gaming can bring.",
    "D23:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Good to hear from you. Sounds like fun! Meeting new people can be overwhelming, but the rewards can be great. Sometimes it's good to step outside our comfort zones and explore new things.",
    "D23:3": "Nate said:Yeah, you're right! We can have great experiences if we take risks. I even made some friends at the convention who love games just like me. We already planned a gaming session together - it's cool to meet people who have the same interests!",
    "D23:4": "Joanna said:That looks awesome! I'm glad you met people who share your interests - that definitely makes experiences more fun..",
    "D23:5": "Nate said:I also met some people who also played this boardgame I love, so I joined in. We had a lot in common and hit it off. It's great when shared hobbies can bond people!",
    "D23:6": "Joanna said:It's incredible how a game can bring people together and form strong relationships. Did you do anything else there?",
    "D23:7": "Nate said:We played this game Catan - it's a great strategy game where you build settlements and trade resources. I love it!",
    "D23:8": "Joanna said:Looks cool! Is it more of a competitive game or a more chill one?",
    "D23:9": "Nate said:It can be both competitive and chill. We were competing, but still had lots of fun.",
    "D23:10": "Joanna said:Competitive games can definitely be difficult to play sometimes when people get all upset about every move you make, but it's cool they were all chill! Glad you had a good time.",
    "D23:11": "Nate said:It was great! Playing games is my escape from life struggles, so I generally don't get crazy competitive over them. The people at the convention were the same way!",
    "D23:12": "Joanna said:Glad you found a way to have fun and escape! It's important to stay happy and de-stress. Keep doing what makes you happy!",
    "D23:13": "Nate said:For sure! You should go to a writing convention or something sometime! The experience at this convention is unforgetable.",
    "D23:14": "Joanna said:Do writing conventions exist? I'll have to look into that, it could be fun! Thanks for the idea. Have you been up to anything tonight?",
    "D23:15": "Nate said:Mostly just chilling at home. Playing video games or watching movies helps me unwind.",
    "D23:16": "Joanna said:That sounds great! What's your favorite game or movie that you've seen recently?",
    "D23:17": "Nate said:I recently saw a movie that blew my mind with all the twists and dream stuff, I think it was called \"Inception\". I've also been playing a game nonstop with a great futuristic setting and gameplay called \"Cyberpunk 2077\". Have you seen or played anything good lately?",
    "D23:18": "Joanna said:I watched a classic movie the other day that was awesome - the story was so gripping and the actors were great! It really stuck with me.",
    "D23:19": "Nate said:Wow, that must have been awesome! What would you rate it?",
    "D23:20": "Joanna said:Well, it was amazing, so probably 9 or 10 out of 10! Movies can take us to different places and make us feel lots of emotions. What do you love about watching them?",
    "D23:21": "Nate said:Well they take me to new worlds and fill me with emotions. Plus, they're great for chilling out after a day.",
    "D23:22": "Joanna said:I agree! They have the power to take us away and make us feel things not normally experienced in life. It's a great escape! Especially when you have a room like this!",
    "D23:23": "Nate said:Wow, it's so comfy in there! I should really get a set up like that.",
    "D23:24": "Joanna said:You should! It's one thing to watch a movie in a theater, but on a nice comfy couch with a good blanket, I feel so at peace!",
    "D23:25": "Nate said:Any pointers on what I should get for my living room to make it comfy like that?",
    "D23:26": "Joanna said:Sure! For one, you should get a couch that can sit multiple people so that you can lay down if you want, and make sure its really fluffy! Also invest in a blanket that has a little bit of weight to it, and some lights that can be dimmed.",
    "D23:27": "Nate said:Sounds like you really got into making your living room! Thanks, I'll try that out for myself!",
    "D23:28": "Joanna said:No problem! I get super invested in random little things like that, but I think its all worth it when I end up with random little things that make life so much nicer.",
    "D23:29": "Nate said:Thanks for the tip! See you later!",
    "D23:30": "Joanna said:See ya Nate!",
    "D24:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, what's been up? Haven't seen you since we last talked.",
    "D24:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! I have been revising and perfecting the recipe I made for my family and it turned out really tasty. What's been happening with you?",
    "D24:3": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! That's cool. I've been getting so stressed lately because of my tournament progress - tough competitors - but my turtles always cheer me up.",
    "D24:4": "Joanna said:Pets have a way of brightening our days. I still have that stuffed animal dog you gave me! I named her Tilly, and she's always with me while I write.",
    "D24:5": "Nate said:Glad to hear it! What made you name her Tilly?",
    "D24:6": "Joanna said:I used to have a dog back in Michigan with that name, but then I got allergic and we had to get rid of her. The name helps me remember her back when I used to be able to hold and squeeze animal without an allergic reaction!",
    "D24:7": "Nate said:That's so touching! Glad the stuffed animal means so much!",
    "D24:8": "Joanna said:Tilly helps me stay focused and brings me so much joy. It's amazing how even stuffed animals can do that!",
    "D24:9": "Nate said:It really is, I'm not sure I'll ever understand why watching my turtles slowly walk around makes me so happy. But I'm very glad it does.",
    "D24:10": "Joanna said:Same here! So have you been up to anything recenly?",
    "D24:11": "Nate said:Yeah, I've just been practicing for my next video game tournemant. How about you?",
    "D24:12": "Joanna said:Well, I had a bit of a setback recently - another rejection from a production company.",
    "D24:13": "Nate said:Bummer, Joanna. Is this the one you sent to a film contest? Rejections suck, but don't forget they don't define you. Keep at it and you'll find the perfect opportunity.",
    "D24:14": "Joanna said:Yeah.. Thanks, Nate. It's hard, but I won't let it slow me down. I'm gonna keep grinding and moving ahead.",
    "D24:15": "Nate said:That's what I like to hear! I really respect you for that and being able to bounce back whenever something sad happens!",
    "D24:16": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Your encouragement really means a lot. I'm gonna keep pushing forward and believing in myself.",
    "D24:17": "Nate said:You got this, and don't ever forget that you have people cheering you on from the sidelines wherever you go.",
    "D24:18": "Joanna said:Thanks! I'll see you around!",
    "D24:19": "Nate said:No problem! Catch you later!",
    "D25:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, what's been up since we last chatted? How's it going?",
    "D25:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Another movie script that I contributed to was shown on the big screen last Sunday for the first time! It was such a surreal experience to see everything come together. I felt a mix of emotions, but overall, it was a satisfying moment. I've been waiting for this for a long time!",
    "D25:3": "Nate said:Congrats Joanna! How was it to finally see it on the big screen?\n\n[shares a photo holding a videogame controller]",
    "D25:4": "Joanna said:It was an amazing experience! I'll never forget seeing all of the characters and dialogue I wrote being acted out - it was such a cool feeling. Having all the hard work and determination I put into writing pay off was definitely rewarding. I know this is the third time it's happened, but its just so awesome!",
    "D25:5": "Nate said:That must have been amazing. What was your favorite part of it?",
    "D25:6": "Joanna said:Seeing my characters I worked so hard on come alive was my favorite part. It felt like they jumped off the page and became real - it was totally surreal.",
    "D25:7": "Nate said:Wow Joanna, those drawings are really incredible! What inspired you to create them?",
    "D25:8": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! They're visuals of the characters to help bring them alive in my head so I can write better.",
    "D25:9": "Nate said:That's a cool way to gain insight into your characters. Where did you get your ideas for them?",
    "D25:10": "Joanna said:I got ideas from everywhere: people I know, stuff I saw, even what I imagined. It's cool to see how an idea takes shape into a person with their own wants, worries, and wishes.",
    "D25:11": "Nate said:Wow Joanna, that's so cool! It's amazing how our imaginations can bring ideas to life. Can you tell me more about the character on the left in the photo?",
    "D25:12": "Joanna said:Nope! You'll just have to watch the movie and find out for yourself!",
    "D25:13": "Nate said:You got it. I was already planning on watching it, but talking to you about it makes me want to watch it even more!",
    "D25:14": "Joanna said:Awesome! Well enough about me, what have you been up to?",
    "D25:15": "Nate said:I was bored today, so I just took my turtles out for a walk.",
    "D25:16": "Joanna said:Sound fun! Did they have a good time?",
    "D25:17": "Nate said:Of course! They look tired from all the walking, so they're relaxing in the tank right now.",
    "D25:18": "Joanna said:Aww, they're so cute! What do they eat?",
    "D25:19": "Nate said:They eat a combination of vegetables, fruits, and insects. They have a varied diet.",
    "D25:20": "Joanna said:Wow, that's fascinating! It's interesting how they have such a varied diet, including insects. Do you have a favorite among their food choices?",
    "D25:21": "Nate said:I love seeing them eat fruit - they get so hyped and it's so cute!",
    "D25:22": "Joanna said:Wow, that's so cute! They look like they really enjoy fruit.",
    "D25:23": "Nate said:Yeah, it's adorable! Watching them enjoy their favorite snacks is so fun. I also like holding them.",
    "D25:24": "Joanna said:Do they have different personalities, like the way dogs and cats do?",
    "D25:25": "Nate said:Yeah, they each do. One is more adventurous while the other is more reserved, which I find cute. Having them around brings me joy and they make great companions.",
    "D25:26": "Joanna said:That's super cool! I never knew turtles could be so interesting until I met your turtles. Wow!",
    "D25:27": "Nate said:I've always liked turtles since I was a boy, so I know all about them!",
    "D25:28": "Joanna said:You'll have to keep me posted on them! It's been fun chatting!",
    "D25:29": "Nate said:See you later Joanna!",
    "D26:1": "Joanna said:Wow, Nate, I'm on fire! I just set up meetings with movie producers — my dreams are comin' true!",
    "D26:2": "Nate said:Wow Joanna, nice work! How did it go with those producer meetings?",
    "D26:3": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! The meetings went really well. I felt confident discussing my script and vision and they seemed interested and excited. They loved the elements of self-discovery in it. It was so validating to be taken seriously. I'm feeling hopeful and inspired about the future!",
    "D26:4": "Nate said:Way to go, Joanna! Putting yourself out there is really brave and winning recognition for your hard work feels great. It's just like when I win a video game tournament - it feels awesome! I'm so proud of you and so glad you're feeling hopeful and inspired.",
    "D26:5": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! Your support and encouragement mean a lot. Writing isn't always easy but moments like these make me appreciate it. I'm so thankful for all the opportunities. Last week, I found these old notebooks with my early writings - it was cool to see how far I've come.",
    "D26:6": "Nate said:That's cool! You must love seeing how you've grown as an artist. Is there a favorite piece from your early writings that stands out to you?",
    "D26:7": "Joanna said:Yup, I still remember this story from when I was 10. It was about a brave little turtle who was scared but explored the world anyway. Maybe even back then, I was inspired by stories about finding courage and taking risks. It's still a part of my writing today.",
    "D26:8": "Nate said:You obviously have a passion for writing, and it's funny the story was about a turtle! Their resilience is so inspiring! Take courage and keep pushing yourself with your writing. Great job!",
    "D26:9": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! They make me think of strength and perseverance. They help motivate me in tough times - glad you find that inspiring!",
    "D26:10": "Nate said:What can I say, I love turtles. So, what's been happening with you?",
    "D26:11": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Apart from meetings, I'm working on a project - challenging but fulfilling. How about you? What's been going on?",
    "D26:12": "Nate said:Just been helping some friends reset their high scores at the international tournament. It's been fun!",
    "D26:13": "Joanna said:Wow, sounds like so much fun! You're really passionate about gaming. Have an awesome time and keep helping others with those high scores!",
    "D26:14": "Nate said:Thanks! It feels good to use my skills to make a difference.",
    "D26:15": "Joanna said:I couldn't agree more! Which is why my meetings are so exciting!",
    "D26:16": "Nate said:On another note, want to come over and try some of this? It's super yummy, just made it yesterday!",
    "D26:17": "Joanna said:Mmm, that looks delicious! Is it lactose-free by any chance?",
    "D26:18": "Nate said:Yep, I made it with coconut milk so it's lactose-free!",
    "D26:19": "Joanna said:Thanks so much, Nate! Sure! I'll come over tomorrow if that's fine.",
    "D26:20": "Nate said:I don't see why not! I'm not doing anything then, so your completely welcome to!",
    "D26:21": "Joanna said:Awesome! I'll bring some of my recipes so we can both share deserts!",
    "D26:22": "Nate said:I'd love that! I've been wanting to try some of your chocolate and rasberry cake for a while now.",
    "D26:23": "Joanna said:You got it! See you tomorrow!",
    "D26:24": "Nate said:See you then! Take care!",
    "D27:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna! Hope you’re doing alright. Crazy thing happened - I was in the final of a big Valorant tournament last Saturday, and I won! It was the best feeling to see my name as the champion. Tournaments really bring out strong emotions in me.",
    "D27:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate! Congrats on winning the tournament - that's awesome! I know you must have been buzzing! Anyway, I've been working on something exciting too. Last Friday, I finished the presentation for producers - it was tough but it's looking good. What have you been up to?",
    "D27:3": "Nate said:Thanks, Joanna! I've been having a blast and preparing for other tournaments, so I've been real busy - but I'm loving it!",
    "D27:4": "Joanna said:Sounds like you're really loving life right now! It's great when you find something that suits you. Being busy can be tiring but it's so rewarding in the end. Keep it up!",
    "D27:5": "Nate said:Thanks, Joanna! I'm really grateful to have a job I enjoy every day. So anyways, anything new going on in your life?",
    "D27:6": "Joanna said:I am writing another movie script! It's a love story with lots of challenges. I've put lots of hard work into it and I'm hoping to get it on the big screen.",
    "D27:7": "Nate said:Woah Joanna, that's incredible! I remember when you started working on these sorta things. It's crazy to see how far you've gotten! You've really got a thing for writing, huh? Where'd you get the idea for it?",
    "D27:8": "Joanna said:Thanks Nate! Writing has always been a passion of mine. I got the idea for this script from a dream. How have your turtles been? I haven't seen pictures of them in a while!",
    "D27:9": "Nate said:Great actually! These little guys sure bring joy to my life! Watching them is so calming and fascinating. I've really grown fond of them. So, what about you, Joanna? What brings you happiness?",
    "D27:10": "Joanna said:Creating stories and watching them come alive gives me happiness and fulfillment. Writing has been such a blessing for me.",
    "D27:11": "Nate said:Well with dedication like yours, its no wonder you do so well in it as well! Are you planning on submitting anymore scripts anytime soon?",
    "D27:12": "Joanna said:Yep! I actually just submitted a few more last week! Hoping to hear back from them soon, though I assume a few will be rejected.",
    "D27:13": "Nate said:Even if it happens to a few, I'm sure at leasts one will make it to the screens and be your 3rd published movie!",
    "D27:14": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! Appreciate the encouragement. I won't give up, I promise! Got it covered!",
    "D27:15": "Nate said:Great to hear! On another note, I just upgraded some of my equipment at home. Check it out!",
    "D27:16": "Joanna said:Oh wow, ice set-up! Do you use that computer for gaming?",
    "D27:17": "Nate said:Yep! This is where I practice and compete. Sometimes I even use it when I'm playing games with friends.",
    "D27:18": "Joanna said:Cool! Having a dedicated space for practice and competition should help you stay focused.",
    "D27:19": "Nate said:Yeah, I love it. It's like my own little haven to escape into the virtual world.",
    "D27:20": "Joanna said:Wow, that sounds great to have your own gaming setup at home. It must be really awesome!",
    "D27:21": "Nate said:It really is! But it's also really important to have something like this for my career, otherwise I would never be able to beat my competition.",
    "D27:22": "Joanna said:That makes sense! It's all about practice isn't it? So what's your favorite game?",
    "D27:23": "Nate said:Yep! I'm currently playing this awesome fantasy RPG called \"Xeonoblade Chronicles\" and it's been a blast! I highly reccomend it if you've never played it before. ",
    "D27:24": "Joanna said:What made you start playing it? That's a japanese game series right?",
    "D27:25": "Nate said:Yes it is! I'm a big fan of Nintendo games, and I've actually been wanting to play this one for a while because my friends have played it and reccomended it!",
    "D27:26": "Joanna said:Nice! It's really cool when a reccomendation from a friend fits your taste so well isn't it?",
    "D27:27": "Nate said:For sure! That's why I love when you give me movie reccomendations, I usually like them a lot more then if I were to just watch some random one.",
    "D27:28": "Joanna said:Great to hear! I just finished with the intro to my next movie script, and I decided to include this at the begining.",
    "D27:29": "Nate said:That letter is really awesome! Does it remind you of your childhood?",
    "D27:30": "Joanna said:Yeah, it does! My brother wrote it - he used to make me these cute notes when we were kids. Brings back sweet memories.",
    "D27:31": "Nate said:Aww, childhood memories can be so powerful!",
    "D27:32": "Joanna said:They sure can! They take us back to simpler times but it's nice to create new memories as we grow up.",
    "D27:33": "Nate said:Totally! I had a special day when I took my pets to the park. They were amazed and seeing their happy faces made it a memorable day. Mixing the new with the old is priceless - I treasure every memory!",
    "D27:34": "Joanna said:That sounds so sweet, Nate! I started writing some of my favorite memories down.",
    "D27:35": "Nate said:Dang, your full of great ideas Joanna! I really should start doing that as well, or at least write down the things my animals like a lot!",
    "D27:36": "Joanna said:You should! I completely encourage it, looking back on fond memories is such a blessing.",
    "D27:37": "Nate said:Ok I will! But I'll also start writing down some of my favorite memories with you from now on.",
    "D27:38": "Joanna said:Definitely, let's keep making great memories and supporting each other. Let's keep reaching for our dreams and make them happen!",
    "D28:1": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, what a wild week! My game tournament got pushed back, so I tried out some cooking. Look at this homemade coconut ice cream! The sprinkles kinda changed the color this time around.",
    "D28:2": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, that looks yummy! Wish I could try it, but I can't right now. How did the last game tournament go?",
    "D28:3": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, thanks! Tough tournament, didn't make it to the finals. But that's okay, I'll get 'em next time!",
    "D28:4": "Joanna said:Aww, bummer! But the important thing is to stay positive. So, what's your next move in the gaming world?",
    "D28:5": "Nate said:Thanks Joanna! Staying positive is key. I'm thinking of joining a new gaming team after this next tourney - I've had a few offers, but I haven't decided yet. It's gonna be a big step, but I'm ready for a shake up.",
    "D28:6": "Joanna said:Sounds great, Nate! Making a switch could open up new opportunities. Wishing you luck with picking the right team!",
    "D28:7": "Nate said:Thanks, Joanna! I really appreciate it. It's a big decision, but I'm excited for what the future holds. How about you? Anything exciting happening on your end?",
    "D28:8": "Joanna said:Yup! I worked hard on another script and eventually created a plan for getting it made into a movie. It was a ton of work but satisfying. I pitched it to some producers yesterday and they really liked it. It gave me a big confidence boost!",
    "D28:9": "Nate said:Congrats on the chance to pitch your script - super impressive. Proud of you!",
    "D28:10": "Joanna said:Appreciate you, Nate! Your support and encouragement mean a lot to me. I feel like I just can't stop writing write now!",
    "D28:11": "Nate said:Anytime. What're you working on in that notebook? Anything cool?",
    "D28:12": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, I'm working on a new project - a suspenseful thriller set in a small Midwestern town. It's been a great creative outlet for me. How about you? Do you have any projects you're working on?",
    "D28:13": "Nate said:Yeah actually - creating gaming content for YouTube. It's a cool way to entertain folks and satisfy my video game cravings at the same time when there aren't any tourneys going on.",
    "D28:14": "Joanna said:Wow, that's a cool idea! What inspired you to start making gaming videos?",
    "D28:15": "Nate said:Hey Joanna, I'm a big fan of them and thought it would be a fun idea to start making them myself. I'm hoping to share my love of gaming and connect with others who enjoy it too.",
    "D28:16": "Joanna said:Way to go, Nate! Making videos and connecting with people about gaming - that's awesome! You'll do great!",
    "D28:17": "Nate said:Thanks Joanna! Appreciate the support. It's new to me but I'm excited to get started!",
    "D28:18": "Joanna said:Make sure you watch other peoples videos first so you get a handle on what your audience likes! That way your videos don't flop when you post them.",
    "D28:19": "Nate said:Already doing that, but thanks for the advice!",
    "D28:20": "Joanna said:No worries, Nate! It's great to support each other in reaching our goals. On another note, check out this pic I got a while back!",
    "D28:21": "Nate said:Wow, that sunset pic looks incredible! What inspired you to take that photo?",
    "D28:22": "Joanna said:Thanks, Nate! I took that pic on a hike last summer near Fort Wayne. The sunset and the surrounding beauty were just incredible. It was an awesome reminder of nature's beauty.",
    "D28:23": "Nate said:That sounds incredible! Nature truly has a way of reminding us to appreciate the beauty around us, and moments like those really stay with you. These critters also make me appreciate life's little joys. And guess what? I got them a new friend!",
    "D28:24": "Joanna said:Wow, what made you get a third?",
    "D28:25": "Nate said:Turtles really bring me joy and peace. They have such an effect on us - best buddies ever! I saw another at a pet store and just hade to get him. The tank is big enough now for three, so I figured why not!",
    "D28:26": "Joanna said:Wow! It's always a shock where life will take us next! I bet just last week you would have never thought you would be getting a third turtle this year!",
    "D28:27": "Nate said:You got that right, but I'm very happy with the descision and wouldn't have it any other way.",
    "D28:28": "Joanna said:Can I come over sometime and watch you play with them? From a distance I mean, since I'm allergic.",
    "D28:29": "Nate said:Definitely! I'd love to have you over again. Maybe we can watch one of your movies together or go to the park!",
    "D28:30": "Joanna said:For sure! I'd love to do either of those things with you!",
    "D28:31": "Nate said:Sounds good. Well I'll make sure I give the turtles a bath before you get here so they're ready to play.",
    "D28:32": "Joanna said:Alright, see you tomorrow!",
    "D28:33": "Nate said:Bye Joanna!",
    "D29:1": "Joanna said:Nate, can you believe it? I'm finally filming my own movie from the road-trip script!",
    "D29:2": "Nate said:Congrats, Joanna! Not surprised at all that your hard work paid off. Must feel awesome to see your script come alive in a movie! Pretty cool when something you love brings success, right? Tell me more about your movie!",
    "D29:3": "Joanna said:Woohoo, thanks Nate! It's pretty wild to see it come alive. Every day on set is awesome and full of potential. Being able to show my vision is awesome.",
    "D29:4": "Nate said:I think so too! What's been the coolest moment on set?",
    "D29:5": "Joanna said:One of the actors came up to me and told me how much she liked my script! I was so excited when that happened - it gave me chills!",
    "D29:6": "Nate said:Wow Joanna, that must have been so exciting! It's incredible when you get those moments of joy. Anyway, I took my turtles to the beach in Tampa yesterday! They always bring me peace in the craziness of life.",
    "D29:7": "Joanna said:Woah, that's awesome, Nate! You must really enjoy having them around - they're so cool! What do you love most about having them?",
    "D29:8": "Nate said:Your completely right! I really love having them around. They're so cool and they make me feel calm. Plus, they don't require much looking after, which is great. I love seeing them soaking in the sun like this.",
    "D29:9": "Joanna said:That's awesome, Nate! They look so serene and happy. It's great to have something like that.",
    "D29:10": "Nate said:Yeah, turtles are like zen masters! They always remind me to slow down and appreciate the small things in life. I'm loving experimenting with flavors right now. Here are some colorful bowls of coconut milk ice cream that I made.",
    "D29:11": "Joanna said:Hey Nate, that looks really yummy! The colors and mix-ins give it a nice kick.",
    "D29:12": "Nate said:Nice! I'm glad you like it too. This recipe really jazzes it up. Wanna give it a try?",
    "D29:13": "Joanna said:Definitely, Nate! That ice cream looks mouthwatering. Thanks so much for offering!",
