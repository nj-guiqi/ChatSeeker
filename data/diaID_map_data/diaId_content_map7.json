    "D4:17": "Jolene said:Can you explain how to do it?",
    "D4:18": "Deborah said:Sure! To do this modified pose, sit on the edge of a chair with your feet planted. Twist your torso to one side and use your hand on your knee for support. You'll feel a stretch in your back and shoulders as you hold it for a few breaths, then switch sides. It's great for relaxing tense muscles.",
    "D4:19": "Jolene said:Sounds really hard! Here's my bookshelf!",

    "D4:29": "Jolene said:That's really sweet. Such a small thing can make a real difference.",
    "D4:30": "Deborah said:It's amazing how something as simple as flowers can make a real difference. Nature sure is beautiful.",
    "D4:31": "Jolene said:Where are some of your favorite nature spots?",
    "D4:32": "Deborah said:Oh, there's so many great places! My favorite is a park with a forest trail - it's so calming getting lost in nature. Then there's this beach nearby that I love - the sound of the waves and the sand under my feet make me feel all peaceful and happy. Do you have any favorite spots, Jolene?",
    "D4:33": "Jolene said:Here's a picture I took on vacation last summer in Bogota. It was so beautiful and calming watching the sunset over the water. It definitely made me appreciate nature's calming power.",
    "D4:34": "Deborah said:That sounds great, Jolene. Nature's calming for sure. Guess it helps us forget the daily craziness and find inner peace. No wonder you're a fan! I like to come to this spot by the water near my mom's old house. It's where I reflect on her life and find some peace. Being surrounded by nature helps a lot.",
    "D4:35": "Jolene said:That's so touching! Do you have any little traditions that you do when you come to reflect on your mom?",
    "D4:36": "Deborah said:Do you remember this amulet from her? Whenever I come here, I bring it with me. It's how I feel her love and stay close to her. Holding it brings me comfort.",
    "D4:37": "Jolene said:It's amazing how something so small can have such a big impact, huh?",
    "D4:38": "Deborah said:Yeah, even small things like this can make a big difference. It's a reminder of all the love and strength we have inside, connecting us to people we've lost and comforting us.",
    "D4:39": "Jolene said:It can keep them close in our hearts every day.",
    "D4:40": "Deborah said:Anna also has a pendant that she wears in memory of her mother! This also brought us closer.",
    "D4:41": "Jolene said:It's nice to have those reminders as a source of strength when we need it.",

    "D4:43": "Jolene said:Thanks, Deb! Your encouragement means a lot to me. I'll definitely stay in touch. Bye, take care and keep shining!",
    "D4:44": "Deborah said:Stay safe!  Bye!",
    "D5:1": "Jolene said:Hey Deborah! Been a few days since we last talked so I wanted to fill you in on something cool. Last Wednesday I did a mini retreat to assess where I'm at in life. It was a dope experience that totally gave me a new outlook.",
    "D5:2": "Deborah said:Hey Jolene! Sounds great. Taking time to reflect can be really awesome. Did you gain any new insights from it?",
    "D5:3": "Jolene said:Yep! I achieved so much more than I imagined. It was a real confidence boost.",

    "D6:2": "Deborah said:Sounds great, Jolene! I just visited this place and it was so calming. Nostalgic too.",
    "D6:3": "Jolene said:Wow, those flowers are beautiful! What type are they? It looks so peaceful there.",
    "D6:4": "Deborah said:The roses and dahlias bring me peace. I lost a friend last week, so I've been spending time in the garden to find some comfort.",
    "D6:5": "Jolene said:Sorry to hear about your friend, Deb. Losing someone can be really tough. How are you holding up?",
    "D6:6": "Deborah said:Thanks for the kind words. It's been tough, but I'm comforted by remembering our time together. It reminds me of how special life is.",
    "D6:7": "Jolene said:Memories can give us so much comfort and joy.",

    "D7:3": "Jolene said:They seriously saved me. I chill out and gain perspective when I do yoga. Afterward, I'm more alert and motivated. Here is my last photo.",
    "D7:4": "Deborah said:Wow, cool that yoga has been helping you out! Do they also do yoga with you? Does your partner do yoga with you?",
    "D7:5": "Jolene said:He started joining me sometimes, which is nice for bonding and relaxing. It's brought us closer. This is just our random photo.",
    "D7:6": "Deborah said:Aw, that's wonderful! How long have you been married?",
    "D7:7": "Jolene said:We're not married yet but we've been together for three years. We're taking it slow and loving the ride. This ring on his hand is just a decoration, not a wedding ring.",

    "D7:17": "Jolene said: I'm curious, what does your daily routine look like?",
    "D7:18": "Deborah said:In the morning, I meditate, do yoga, and teach classes. And yesterday I went for a morning jog for the first time in a nearby park. I will now incorporate this into my daily routine. And in the evenings, I spend time with loved ones.",
    "D7:19": "Jolene said:Why did you decide that?",
    "D7:20": "Deborah said:Exercise is key for me - it makes me feel connected to my body. ",
    "D7:21": "Jolene said:This is a great healthy habit!",
    "D7:22": "Deborah said:It's like they say - \"Can't pour from an empty cup.\" Looking out for ourselves gives us the energy to help others. And don't forget, you're worth it too!",
    "D7:23": "Jolene said:Thanks, Deb. Your words really mean something to me. I'll keep remembering to prioritize self-care.",
    "D8:1": "Deborah said:Hey Jolene, Anna got me a vegan stir-fry the other day - tofu and veg with ginger and soy sauce. It was really tasty! Food is such a wonderful source of pleasure and nourishment. What dishes are comforting to you?",
    "D8:2": "Jolene said:One of my favorite dishes is lasagna! Comfort food can be a great pick-me-up. I've got a lot going on with my studies and exams.",
    "D8:3": "Deborah said:Have you been able to find time for yourself lately?",
    "D8:4": "Jolene said:I've been trying to squeeze in some me-time. Last Friday, I did yoga and meditation to relax. Did you find time for yourself too?",
    "D8:5": "Deborah said: I also did the same, it helped me reset my mind. How does it make you feel?",
    "D8:6": "Jolene said:It's amazing how a few quiet moments can work wonders for the soul.",
    "D8:7": "Deborah said:Have you been able to get outside lately?",

    "D10:5": "Deborah said:I create a daily schedule or to-do list. Here's my example for today.",
    "D10:6": "Jolene said:I tried making one but it's kinda overwhelming when it's a big stack of tasks. Here's an example from last Friday.",
    "D10:7": "Deborah said:Have you tried breaking it down or prioritizing the tasks?",
    "D10:8": "Jolene said:It can often feel overwhelming and difficult to figure out where to start.",

    "D10:10": "Jolene said:Nah, I'm not familiar with that one. What's it about?",
    "D10:11": "Deborah said:Want me to tell you about it? It helps you organize things based on how important and urgent they are.",
    "D10:12": "Jolene said:Sure, tell me more about it! It sounds useful.",

    "D12:2": "Jolene said:Hey Deborah! Sounds like you had a blast biking and at the art show. Your photo looks like you were really into it! Did it make you think profound thoughts?",
    "D12:3": "Deborah said:My mom was interested in art. She believed art could give out strong emotions and uniquely connect us. When I go to an art show, it's like we're still experiencing it together even though she's gone. It's hard but comforting.",
    "D12:4": "Jolene said:Losing someone is hard, but finding something that helps you cope is great.",
    "D12:5": "Deborah said:Finding ways to keep her memory alive gives me peace. It's amazing how something simple like artwork can bring back powerful emotions and remind us of those we've lost. It's about finding solace in the things we love, and art has done that for me.",
    "D12:6": "Jolene said:Even though my snakes can't chat or understand what I'm going through, our time together is valuable and teaches me to take time and be in tune with myself. Similarly, playing video games with my partner after a long day is a great way for me to relax.",

    "D13:14": "Deborah said: Have you considered taking some breaks and finding activities like yoga to help you relax and unwind? That might make a difference.",
    "D13:15": "Jolene said:Yeah, I`m trying to do it. Here's an example of how I spent yesterday morning, yoga on top of mount Talkeetna.",
    "D13:16": "Deborah said:Nice job, Jolene! How long have you been doing yoga and meditation? It looks like it's really helping you regroup and recharge.",

    "D13:22": "Deborah said:This is my favorite studio and it's always so calming. ",
    "D13:23": "Jolene said: I was wondering if you have any advice on calming the mind and breathing during yoga?",
    "D13:24": "Deborah said:I'd recommend practicing mindful breathing for yoga. Set aside a few minutes each day to sit with your eyes closed, take deep breaths, and focus on how the air feels entering and leaving your body. ",
    "D13:25": "Jolene said:Thanks, Deborah! I'll definitely give it a try. Appreciate the advice!",
    "D13:26": "Deborah said: If you need more tips or help, just let me know. Take care!",
    "D13:27": "Jolene said:See you!",
    "D14:1": "Deborah said:Hey Jolene! How's it going? We haven't talked in a while. I've been busy getting ready for a yoga retreat with some buddies. A chance to hang out with people who think like me and find peace and understanding. Sounds awesome!",
    "D14:2": "Jolene said:Hey Deb! Been super hectic with internship and stuff. That retreat sounds awesome, I could definitely use a break!",

    "D18:5": "Jolene said: Not only does it help me stay on top of everything, but it's also so satisfying when I cross tasks off my list. Here's a pic of my newest spread with one of my favorite quotes.",
    "D18:6": "Deborah said:I love this quote. So uplifting. Does it motivate you when you see it?",
    "D18:7": "Jolene said:Yeah, it's like a little reminder to stick to my goals and never give up.",
    "D18:8": "Deborah said:Gotcha! Visual reminders like this photo can be super motivating. Keep focusing on your goals, Jolene, and don't give up! I led a meditation yoga sessionto the elderly at a local care home last week during sunset. Nature can be really helpful for finding peace. Have you tried mindfulness too? ",
    "D18:9": "Jolene said:Haven't tried it yet, but I'm keen to give it a shot. That sounds really peaceful. I could use some of that calm in my life right now.  I'm interested in destressing and trying mindfulness. ",
    "D18:10": "Deborah said:I started with workshops and books, and now mindfulness is a huge part of my life.",

    "D19:2": "Jolene said:Life's been hella busy since we last talked. I bought a console for my partner as a gift on the 17th and it's so much fun, he even managed to play it.! Engineering studies are still going strong too. Balance has been key for me lately. How about you? What's been up?",
    "D19:3": "Deborah said: Well done! As for me, I've been focusing on teaching yoga and spending time with the community. Organizing a yoga event last month was really cool.",
    "D19:4": "Jolene said: Was it rewarding seeing everyone come together? Can you tell me more about how you put it together? Also, any tips for maintaining a balance between hobbies and studies?",
    "D19:5": "Deborah said: I reached out to different nearby businesses and places to make it happen. We had yoga, food stalls, and even some live music - it was amazing! As for balancing hobbies and studies, I find it helpful to prioritize and manage my time effectively. Making a schedule and setting aside specific time for studying and pursuing hobbies can go a long way in maintaining balance.",
    "D19:6": "Jolene said:Wow, that's awesome! Gonna make a plan to manage my studies and hobbies. Say, do you ever play video games?",
    "D19:7": "Deborah said:I used to play some video games, but it's been a while. It's a good way to relax after a busy day. Do you have any game suggestions? What's your favorite game?",
    "D19:8": "Jolene said:I have a few game recommendations. Zelda BOTW for Switch is an awesome open-world game. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is really calming and cute. As for my favorite game, it's hard to choose just one!",
    "D19:9": "Deborah said:Cool recs! I'll definitely check those out. What about your favorite memories of playing video games?\n",
    "D19:10": "Jolene said:Oh, I forgot to mention Overcooked 2 - this is a good co-op game if you're into hilarious and chaotic cooking. My partner and I often play for bets! I once won three large pizzas!",
    "D19:11": "Deborah said:Reminds me of when I used to play games with my husband. We'd take turns and it was a great way to bond and make memories. Gaming really can bring people closer, right?",
    "D19:12": "Jolene said:Yeah, you`re right! What's your favorite game to play with that person?",
    "D19:13": "Deborah said:We prefer to play detective games together.",
    "D19:14": "Jolene said:What other activities do you both enjoy doing together?",
    "D19:15": "Deborah said:We also enjoyed spending time outdoors and exploring nature. It was always so refreshing to be outside and soak up the fresh air.",

    "D19:17": "Deborah said:I love going to this park near my house - it has a nice forest trail and a beach. It's a peaceful spot where I can do some yoga and reflect. There's also a special bench that holds special meaning to me.",
    "D19:18": "Jolene said:Sounds lovely! Nature can be calming. What makes this bench special to you?",
    "D19:19": "Deborah said:It holds a lot of special memories for me and my mom - we would come here and chat about dreams and life. It's full of good moments. ",
    "D19:20": "Jolene said:That's awesome, Deborah! What were some of your favorite memories with your mom at this spot? It looks super peaceful and pretty.",
    "D19:21": "Deborah said:I'll always cherish my memories with her at this spot. I remember a beautiful sunset we watched together in silence - the colors in the sky were so special. Every time I go back, I feel so much peace and gratitude for the time I spent with her.",

    "D20:1": "Jolene said: Long time no talk! We were given a new game for the console last week, it is Battlefield 1. What's been up with you?",
    "D20:2": "Deborah said:Hey Jolene! Good to hear from you. That`s cool! Been thinking about a few big moments lately - went to a place that held a lot of memories for me. Sat on a bench where we used to chat and it brought back a lot of emotions. ",
    "D20:3": "Jolene said:Mostly happy or a bit of everything?",
    "D20:4": "Deborah said:It was quite a mix, Jolene. I felt nostalgia and longing, but also grateful for the memories. It's amazing how a place can mean so much. I brought these flowers there.",

    "D20:7": "Jolene said:Wow, that's a great photo! How did she show you to appreciate it?",
    "D20:8": "Deborah said:By taking it slow, seeing beauty in them, and finding joy.",
    "D20:9": "Jolene said:Wow Deb, that's awesome! We should definitely take time to enjoy that and not let the business of life cause us to miss out on the good stuff.",
    "D20:10": "Deborah said:Yeah, Jolene. Life can be so busy that we often overlook the small things that truly matter. Let's make an effort to appreciate them more.",
    "D20:11": "Jolene said:Yep Deb, slowing down and enjoying simple moments can bring a lot of balance and happiness. I'm trying to do more yoga and meditation myself to help relax and stay focused. Are there any calming habits that you practice to feel balanced?",
    "D20:12": "Deborah said:Yeah, same here, Jolene! Yoga and meditation help me find balance and inner peace. Going out for walks and staying mindful also keep me grounded. I take similar photos on walks.",

    "D21:16": "Jolene said:Yeah, you're right! I'll take your advice and find joy on the way. Cheers for the support!",
    "D21:17": "Deborah said:Always by your side!",
    "D22:1": "Deborah said:Hey Jolene, since we talked I've been thinking about my mom's influence. Remembering those we love is important.",
    "D22:2": "Jolene said:I understand, Deb. Remembering and cherishing the memories of our loved ones is so important. It's comforting to know that their influence still guides us. Last Friday, my partner and I talked about how our loved ones have influenced us and what their values meant to us. It was an emotional chat, but it made us feel closer and showed us what really matters. ",
    "D22:3": "Deborah said:Those types of conversations really help build relationships. Can you tell me more about the values they have given you?",
    "D22:4": "Jolene said:Definitely! Our loved ones have taught us to persevere and stay resilient, like my mom always said to never give up, and my partner's dad showed them to stay determined. Their values have influenced us to pursue our goals, such as me with engineering and my partner with their creative endeavors. Even though they're not here, we both feel their values encouraging us along our paths.",
    "D22:5": "Deborah said:That's wonderful to hear, Jolene! It's amazing how their values continue to guide you, even in their absence. It sounds like you and your partner are honoring their memory by pursuing your respective passions. Have you ever considered incorporating those values into your work as well?",
    "D22:6": "Jolene said:Yeah, Deborah! We've been figuring out how to add these values into our projects. As an engineering student, I want to use my talents to do good and help solve important problems. I'm keen on coming up with new ideas and making things more efficient to make the world a better place. Going further, my mom stressed the value of helping others and that's something I want to keep in mind for my engineering projects.",

    "D22:8": "Jolene said:In the future, I'm aiming to work on projects that make a real difference to communities. I'm interested in sustainable initiatives and developing innovative solutions for environmental issues. I also want to get involved with organizations that focus on social causes, using my skills to help out. It's about connecting my passion for engineering with my commitment to making a positive impact.",
    "D22:9": "Deborah said:You've got a lot of amazing plans for the future. Which projects are you most interested in getting involved in?",
    "D22:10": "Jolene said:I'm keen on two projects in particular. One is focused on developing renewable energy, like solar, to help communities and reduce dependence on non-renewables. ",
    "D22:11": "Deborah said:Wow Jolene, that's really inspiring!",
    "D22:12": "Jolene said:The other is finding ways to supply clean water to those with limited access. Both align with my beliefs about sustainability and assisting those in need. I still have so much to figure out before beginning, but I'm up for the challenge.",
    "D22:13": "Deborah said:Sounds great, Jolene! Research is key to success. Little steps and being up for challenges make you stronger. I'm here for you. Connecting to yourself helps tackle any issue. Here's a photo that reminds me of the beauty of nature during a yoga session.",

    "D22:15": "Deborah said:Taking breaks, doing some stretching/yoga, or just going for a walk is really helpful. And don't forget to get enough sleep and take time for self-care. Finding a balance between work and taking care of yourself is important. What self-care activities have you been doing lately?",
    "D22:16": "Jolene said:I've been into yoga and meditation lately. It helps me recharge. Doing different poses relieves tension and calms my mind. I've already shared my newfound love for yoga with my partner, and we're planning to go on a meditation retreat together to enhance our practice together.",
    "D22:17": "Deborah said:Glad to hear that yoga is helping you rest and recharge. It's great for reflection and self-care. Do your snakes also enjoy it?",
    "D22:18": "Jolene said:My snakes just like watching me chill. But she's a great company and always brings a sense of calm.",
    "D22:19": "Deborah said:Having a pet around is such a calming feeling. They sure can bring a great sense of comfort. I still have cats, Luna is sitting on the left.",

    "D23:3": "Jolene said:This country was awesome! It showed me different kinds of yoga and their backgrounds, which made me appreciate it even more. We visited a lot of delicious cafes! Have you ever been somewhere that was important to you?",
    "D23:4": "Deborah said:Yep, last month I visited my mom`s house which holds a special place in my heart. My mom had good and bad times there, but it's still a symbol of her strength and the love she shared with me. This is my husband in front of this house.",
    "D23:5": "Jolene said:What was it like?",
    "D23:6": "Deborah said:It brought back fond memories as I relaxed outside.",
    "D23:7": "Jolene said:Sounds great! So glad you have a place to relax and find peace.",

    "D23:13": "Jolene said:Looks great! What made you pick that spot?",
    "D23:14": "Deborah said:The soothing vibes and nice views made it ideal for reflecting and letting go.",
    "D23:15": "Jolene said:Here is one more photo from Rio de Janeiro. We went on many excursions there.",
    "D23:16": "Deborah said:Wow, those stairs look cool! Where were they taken?",
    "D23:17": "Jolene said:We had a great time visiting an old temple. The stairs were amazing!",

    "D23:20": "Deborah said:Exploring historical places and learning their stories is so fun. It was a great experience. I want to share this photo with you.",
    "D23:21": "Jolene said: By the way, what did that paper have written on it in the photo?",
    "D23:22": "Deborah said:This was written to me by a friend who, unfortunately, will never be able to support me. I miss him here. This quote says\"Let go of what no longer serves you.\"",
    "D23:23": "Jolene said:I'm sorry! That's a good reminder to stay focused and let go of what no longer serves us. Remember the quote in my notebook? It also inspires me!",
    "D23:24": "Deborah said:What other quotes give you strength?",
    "D23:25": "Jolene said:I came across this one while browsing and it really hit home with me. It's a great reminder to ditch the negative stuff and focus on growing and being positive.",

    "D24:5": "Deborah said:Relationships with family and friends are so vital. My yoga pals have been my second family - we've held each other up through a lot. The other day I found this old photo. That was when I first started doing yoga. My mum was my biggest fan and source of motivation. She'd often come to my classes with me.",
    "D24:6": "Jolene said:Our loved ones sure are supportive! When I was 10, my parents got me that and it was the start of my passion for video games.",
    "D24:7": "Deborah said:Cool that they shared that with you. Did you learn on your own or did they teach you?",

    "D26:6": "Jolene said:Having a routine helps me stay on top of everything I need to do. I have a schedule for classes, studying, and personal time. Self-care activities like yoga and meditation help me stay balanced and relax.",
    "D26:7": "Deborah said:I'd love to learn more about how you do it.",
    "D26:8": "Jolene said: I can tell you about it if you're interested. It took a bit of experimenting, but it's really helped me.",
    "D26:9": "Deborah said:Sounds great! Let's set up a coffee date and talk about it!",
    "D26:10": "Jolene said:Wanna meet up at that cafe next Monday? Let's try fresh pastries.",
    "D26:11": "Deborah said:Sounds good, Jolene! When did you have in mind? That cafe rocks.",
    "D26:12": "Jolene said:How about Wednesday at 4? Can't wait to catch up over coffee!",
    "D26:13": "Deborah said:That pic looks so peaceful. Reminded me of a cool hidden coffee shop near me. Rate it!",
    "D26:14": "Jolene said:Tell me more about it when we meet, maybe next time we’ll be there.",
    "D26:15": "Deborah said:Sorry, I remembered that I already have plans for this day.",
    "D26:16": "Jolene said:Now I'll see when it's more convenient for me.",
    "D26:17": "Deborah said:Thank you for your understanding, I'm waiting.",
    "D26:18": "Jolene said:How about Friday at 5? I will need to sort out the books from this bookcase and I will be free.",
    "D26:19": "Deborah said:Absolutely, let's do that! Can't wait for our coffee date next week. See you then. Stay safe!",
    "D26:20": "Jolene said:See ya soon, Deb! Be safe and I'm excited for our coffee date!",
    "D26:21": "Deborah said:Maybe just grab me some interesting books!",
    "D27:1": "Jolene said:Hey Deb! So sorry for the late reply, been super busy. Last weekend my partner and I traveled to a meditation retreat for a few weeks in Phuket. Amazing experience! Nature, reflection and a break from engineering studies were awesome - it helped me find inner peace.",
    "D27:2": "Deborah said: I'd love to hear more about your reflections there and how they changed you.",
    "D27:3": "Jolene said:At the retreat, I had time to reflect on what makes me happy. It made me realize the importance of incorporating relaxation, self-care, and balance in life alongside my engineering studies. The beauty of nature there was so inspiring and refreshing!",
    "D27:4": "Deborah said: Was there anything from the retreat that stood out to you?",
    "D27:5": "Jolene said:The one session that really stood out was about releasing expectations and judgments and just savoring the present. It was a strong reminder to not just dwell on the finish line, but to appreciate the journey too. I usually get too consumed with hitting my goals that I forget to appreciate the ride.",
    "D27:6": "Deborah said: I've been thinking about this a lot, too. Life's full of small moments and being grateful for those can really boost our happiness.",
    "D27:7": "Jolene said:Yup, totally agree! Sometimes we get too focused on the big stuff and don't appreciate all the tiny wins. Like the feeling of the sun or a great cup of coffee - can be small but they make life much better. Trying to be more mindful and grateful to take it all in now.",
    "D27:8": "Deborah said:That's great, Jolene! Practicing mindfulness and gratitude can really change our day-to-day. Even just a different outlook can make the little things in life joyful. Glad you're getting into it!",
    "D27:9": "Jolene said:I'm experiencing a new level of joy and happiness!",
    "D27:10": "Deborah said: It's wonderful to see your progress, and I'm excited to be on this journey with you!",
    "D27:11": "Jolene said:Thanks, Deb! Appreciate your support. It's great that we can do this together.",
    "D27:12": "Deborah said:Having a supportive community definitely helps. We can motivate and encourage each other! By the way, I recently played a game. I don't remember what it's called. This is a card game about cats, where you take cards one by one from a deck, and then you can attack your opponent with them. We'll definitely play it with you!",
    "D27:13": "Jolene said:I look forward to meeting you and playing this game!",
    "D28:1": "Deborah said:Since speaking last, I reconnected with my mom's old friends. Their stories made me tear up and reminded me how lucky I am to have had her.",
    "D28:2": "Jolene said: It's great that you could reconnect with them. Hearing stories about our loved ones can be tough but also comforting.",
    "D28:3": "Deborah said:Hearing stories about my mom was emotional. It was both happy and sad to hear things I hadn't heard before. It was a mix of emotions, but overall it was comforting to reconnect with her friends.",
    "D28:4": "Jolene said:It can bring up a range of emotions, and it's okay to feel a mix of happiness and sadness. Those moments with her friends must've been meaningful to you.",
    "D28:5": "Deborah said:Wow, it was so special. A glimpse into her life beyond what I knew. Through their eyes, I appreciate her more. Here I am and my mom.",
    "D28:6": "Jolene said:That looks like a blast! What did you and your mom's friends do on that day?",
    "D28:7": "Deborah said:We reminisced and looked through her photos. It was really sweet.",
    "D28:8": "Jolene said:Looking at old photos must have been so nostalgic! It's great that you could share that experience with friends. It's amazing how photos and memories can give us a deeper appreciation for the people we love.",
    "D28:9": "Deborah said:Pictures really have a way of bringing back memories and making us appreciate the special bond we have with our loved ones. They remind me of how strong love is and how amazing human relationships can be. Just like this one.",
    "D28:10": "Jolene said:Wow, what a gorgeous pic! Do you have any special memories of that beach or just love surfing in general?",
    "D28:11": "Deborah said:That beach is super special to me. It's where I got married and discovered my love for surfing. It's always filled with joy and peace.",
    "D28:12": "Jolene said:What pleasant memories.",
    "D28:13": "Deborah said:Here is another photo from my classes.",
    "D28:14": "Jolene said:Wow, that yoga pose looks amazing! Does it help you relax?",
    "D28:15": "Deborah said:Oh yeah! Doing this on the beach is so peaceful - the ocean, sand, and fresh air create a super relaxing atmosphere. The perfect way to take care of myself.",
    "D28:16": "Jolene said: I like to create my own serene yoga space with candles and oils for extra chill vibes. Also, we tried a new style of meditation in Thailand - with flowers.",
    "D28:17": "Deborah said:Oh, same for me!",
    "D28:18": "Jolene said:I find calm when I do yoga or meditate. I use essential oils and put on some soft, soothing music in the background to create a peaceful atmosphere. It really helps me chill out and center myself.",
    "D28:19": "Deborah said: It's amazing how our environment can enhance our practice.",
    "D28:20": "Jolene said:Yeah, totally! Our surroundings can really affect our mood and how much zen we can get from our routine. Creating a place that feels safe and chill is key.",
    "D28:21": "Deborah said:Wow, that looks so comfy and inviting! Where do you usually go to relax in your house?",
    "D28:22": "Jolene said:In my room, I usually go to relax and feel at ease. After a busy day, it's my little haven for peace and rest - the perfect spot to relax and recharge.",
    "D28:23": "Deborah said:Sounds like your room does the job. That's awesome.",
    "D28:24": "Jolene said: Here are my pals keeping me company.",
    "D28:25": "Deborah said:Hey, that's Susie or Seraphim? How long has he been hanging out with you?",
    "D28:26": "Jolene said:It`s Susie! I've had her for two years now. ",
    "D28:27": "Deborah said:It's awesome how pets can bring us comfort and peace when we need it.",
    "D28:28": "Jolene said:Susie is a great companion.",
    "D28:29": "Deborah said:The love pets give is priceless.",
    "D28:30": "Jolene said:Plus, they make life a lot brighter!",
    "D29:1": "Deborah said:Hey Jolene, I'm so excited to tell you! Yesterday, me and my neighbor ran a free gardening class for the community, it was awesome! People of any age joined in and it was such a great thing to see.",
    "D29:2": "Jolene said:Wow, Deborah, that's awesome! Keep up the great work, and here's hoping for more events like this in the future!",
    "D29:3": "Deborah said: Gardening is really amazing. It brings us together in such a cool way. It was awesome to share my love of plants and help people take care of the world. So, what about you? Anything new happened lately?",
    "D29:4": "Jolene said:We tried a scuba diving lesson last Friday and had an awesome time! We found a cool dive spot we can explore together. Trying new things opens up a world of adventure - maybe one day I'll be a certified diver. Anything fun going on with you?",
    "D29:5": "Deborah said:That sounds amazing, Jolene! I've been interested in underwater life, but I haven't had the chance to try scuba diving yet. Recently, I've been spending time remembering my mom. Last Sunday, I visited her old house and sat on a bench. It was a comforting experience, as if I could feel her presence guide me and remind me of her love.",
    "D29:6": "Jolene said:Visiting your mom's old home sounds like it was really special. Is there something special you remember about her?",
    "D29:7": "Deborah said:Thanks, Jolene! It was really special. My mom had a big passion for cooking. She would make amazing meals for us, each one full of love and warmth. I can still remember the smell of her special dish, it would fill the house and bring us all together.",
    "D29:8": "Jolene said:Mmm, that looks delicious, Deb! So sweet how cooking with your mom brought everyone together. What's your best memory of cooking with her?",
    "D29:9": "Deborah said:I loved it when she would bake pineapple birthday cakes for me when I was a kid. It always made me feel so special.",
    "D29:10": "Jolene said:No wonder it made you feel special. ",
    "D29:11": "Deborah said:Have you ever had something like that with someone close?",
    "D29:12": "Jolene said:I used to bake cookies with someone close to me.",
    "D29:13": "Deborah said:What's your favorite cookie to make?",
    "D29:14": "Jolene said:The warm, gooey chocolate and soft, buttery cookie are a match made in heaven.",
    "D29:15": "Deborah said:I really want to eat this now.",
    "D29:16": "Jolene said:Well look what I have here!",
    "D29:17": "Deborah said: Is there anything special about it or the photo?",
    "D29:18": "Jolene said:It takes me to another world when I read it!",
    "D29:19": "Deborah said:Did I show you that I have a big bookshelf too?",
    "D29:20": "Jolene said:I think not, I really like it!",
    "D29:21": "Deborah said:Having a space like this is important for escaping reality and relaxing with a book. Do you have any books that really moved you?",
    "D29:22": "Jolene said:My bathroom has an aesthetic vibe. Once I read a self-discovery book there and it really resonated with me.",
    "D29:23": "Deborah said:Wow! A special book that speaks to you and helps with self-discovery? That's awesome. Plus, having a cozy nook to chill? That's my best one!",
    "D29:24": "Jolene said:Sounds nice, Deb! A cozy nook is a must! The beach is a great place for finding peace and relaxation. Have you ever tried surfing?",
    "D29:25": "Deborah said:Certainly! Here's the confirmation.",
    "D29:26": "Jolene said:How cool! But I never decided to try it.",
    "D29:27": "Deborah said:It's okay, maybe we can try it together sometime!",
    "D29:28": "Jolene said:I already know what fate awaits me if I do this!",
    "D29:29": "Deborah said:Have you ever been interested in this or do you know nothing about it?",
    "D29:30": "Jolene said:Just started learning, but haven't gone yet. Want to come with me sometime?",
    "D29:31": "Deborah said:It'll be an adventure! Let's make it happen soon!",
    "D29:32": "Jolene said:So glad, all that remains is to agree and choose the right time for both of us.",
    "D29:33": "Deborah said: Can't wait. What day works for you? I'm really excited!",
    "D29:34": "Jolene said:Let's plan for next month - I'll check my schedule and let you know. Can't wait!",
    "D30:1": "Deborah said:I had a great time at the music festival with my pals! The vibes were unreal and the music was magical. It was so freeing to dance and bop around. Music brings us together and helps us show our feelings. It reminds me of my mom and her soothing voice when she'd sing lullabies to me. Lucky to have those memories!",
    "D30:2": "Jolene said:Wow, festivals sound so fun! Here's me and my partner at one last year - had an awesome time! It's my way of expressing myself and getting away from all the stress of everyday life. Just got back from a trip with my partner - so cool!",
    "D30:3": "Deborah said:Wow, what a gorgeous shot! It looks so tranquil and serene. You two look very happy together. Trips create awesome memories that we can share. Where did you go on your trip and what's something you'll never forget?",

    "D30:5": "Deborah said:Wow, what a view!  How did it make you feel?",
    "D30:6": "Jolene said:It was amazing! Doing yoga with that backdrop made me feel connected to nature and myself. I felt incredibly peaceful and thankful.",
    "D30:7": "Deborah said:Like, it's no wonder looking at such beauty can really help us refocus and connect with who we are. Have you ever experienced that?",
    "D30:8": "Jolene said:I remember taking a hike with my partner and coming across a waterfall oasis. Everything just felt so peaceful and my worries just disappeared. It was such a refreshing experience.",
    "D30:9": "Deborah said:Are you planning to experience it again soon?",
    "D30:10": "Jolene said:Yeah! I'm planning to get out in nature again next month. It's going to be great reconnecting with it!",
    "D30:11": "Deborah said: Enjoy it! This photo made me think of a gorgeous blossom tree from near my home. Every spring, it was magical to watch it bloom.",

    "D30:13": "Deborah said:It was like admiring nature's artwork. It filled me with awe and made me appreciate the beauty of life. Even in tough times, there's hope for growth.",
