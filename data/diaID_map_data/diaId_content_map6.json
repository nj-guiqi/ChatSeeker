    "D1:1": "John said:Hey! Glad to finally talk to you. I want to ask you, what motivates you?",
    "D1:2": "James said:Hey John! Video games give me tons of joy and excitement, so they keep me motivated!",
    "D1:3": "John said:Cool, James! I'm a big video game fan too. They help me relax after a long day. What game are you currently enjoying the most?",
    "D1:4": "James said:I'm totally into The Witcher 3 right now. The story and atmosphere are amazing. Have you tried it yet?",
    "D1:5": "John said:Haven't played it yet, but I hear it's awesome. Gonna give it a go. BTW, just signed up for a programming class. Have you ever done any programming?",
    "D1:6": "James said:Programming is an awesome skill. I tried it out one in college and now it`s all my life. Good luck in the class! Do you have any coding experience?",
    "D1:7": "John said:I did a bit of coding in HTML and CSS a few years back. Thought I'd refresh those skills in this course. What languages do you like most and any projects you've done?",
    "D1:8": "James said:I've worked with Python and C++. I've built a website and also created some game mods. Here is one example.",
    "D1:9": "John said:That mod looks amazing! The graphics are awesome. What other programming languages have you worked with?",
    "D1:10": "James said:I haven’t worked with any other programming languages, but I hope to work in the future.",
    "D1:11": "John said:Maybe in the future we will develop mobile applications together? Do you like the idea?",
    "D1:12": "James said:It would be cool! For example, we could write some kind of application for dogs. By the way, my dogs.",
    "D1:13": "John said:Aww, they're adorable! What are the names of your pets? And what are your plans for the app?",
    "D1:14": "James said:Max and Daisy. Will be actually cool to build an app for dog walking and pet care. The goal is to connect pet owners with reliable dog walkers and provide helpful information on pet care.",
    "D1:15": "John said:Sounds good, James! Bet that app would find a lot of buyers. What sets it apart from other existing apps?",
    "D1:16": "James said:Thanks, John! The personal touch really sets it apart. Users can add their pup's preferences/needs - just like they were customizing it for them. Making it unique for each owner and pup.",
    "D1:17": "John said:That's a great idea! Your pup is gonna love it. Speaking of personal touches, what motivates you to work on your programming projects?",
    "D1:18": "James said:Creating something and seeing it come to life gives me a great sense of accomplishment. It's an amazing feeling. I write down all my goals in a notebook. It's very satisfying to check off each one when it's done.",
    "D1:19": "John said:What are you working on that has you feeling so accomplished?",
    "D1:20": "James said:I'm working on something I've wanted to do since I was a kid. Even as a child, I made some sketches of the main character. Back then I was just drawing comics, but now I want to turn it into a computer game. It's a project that has me really excited.",
    "D1:21": "John said:Wow, James! That's amazing. What made you decide to work on it and create your own game?",
    "D1:22": "James said:I'm always excited to combine my favorite passions: gaming and storytelling. It's great creating my own project and bringing my ideas to life, plus the challenge is really enjoyable!",
    "D1:23": "John said:That sounds really fulfilling! Combining your passions to make something new must be so exciting. Can't wait to see the outcome.",
    "D1:24": "James said:Thanks John! It's super exciting. I'll keep you updated on the progress. Perhaps, thanks to your knowledge of HTML, I'll invite you to help with some things in my game.",
    "D1:25": "John said:It will be great to work with you, James.",
    "D1:26": "James said:I'll be looking forward to it. By the way, yesterday I went bowling and got 2 strikes. I love bowling!",
    "D1:27": "John said:I'm sure you're very good at this. Unfortunately, I can’t share my love for him with you, my fingers are too big. Perhaps I should take up exercise, at least start going for a run in the morning. And I also don’t like bowling itself, to be honest.",
    "D1:28": "James said:It's a pity, it would be nice to go play with you one day.",
    "D1:29": "John said:Well, I'm sure we can do something else. We can play slot machines and arcades, for example.",
    "D1:30": "James said:The last time I played at the slot machines, I was so engrossed in the game that I didn't notice my wallet being taken out of my pocket. Sad story.",
    "D1:31": "John said:I'm sorry to hear it. Well, I'll be nearby, I'll look after your pockets.",
    "D1:32": "James said:Still, maybe we can try something different?",
    "D1:33": "John said:Heard about VR gaming? It's pretty immersive. We can try it together!",
    "D1:34": "James said:I tried it - it's crazy how real it feels! Have you given it a shot?",
    "D1:35": "John said:Tried it a few times, it's insane how immersive that experience can be. Can't wait to try it together with you.",
    "D1:36": "James said:Yeah, VR gaming is awesome! Let`s do it next Saturday!",
    "D1:37": "John said:Agreed, James!",
    "D2:1": "James said:Hey John, something awesome happened since we talked. I made a game avatar and joined a new platform. It's so fun exploring and chatting with other gamers - it's a whole new adventure every time! I feel like I'm part of a super cool online community.",
    "D2:2": "John said:Hey James, awesome! Glad you're enjoying it and connecting with others. Building a community is really cool, especially when you meet people who enjoy the same things.",
    "D2:3": "James said:Thanks, John! Connecting with other gamers has been great! We've shared tips, strategies, and stories about gaming. It's amazing how it brings people together, regardless of their backgrounds.",
    "D2:4": "John said:That's incredible! It's so cool how gaming can bring people together and create a strong bond, regardless of their background.",
    "D2:5": "James said:Yeah, it's our shared language and passion. It's been a refuge for me in tough times.",
    "D2:6": "John said:Yeah, gaming always helps me escape stress. It's amazing how it calms me down during tough times.",
    "D2:7": "James said:Games are my go-to when I'm feeling overwhelmed. It's like therapy. I can relax, forget my troubles, and get lost in another world.",
    "D2:8": "John said:Gotcha. Gaming can be a great way to take a break and escape for a while. Anything new you've been into lately?",
    "D2:9": "James said:Lately, I've been checking out different styles of it. It's been fun to try something fresh and test myself in other ways. What about you, John? Any new hobbies recently?",
    "D2:10": "John said:I've been getting into a new hobby recently. I bought a metal detector and walk along the beaches looking for something worthwhile.",
    "D2:11": "James said:Interesting, John! Sounds like an awesome immersive experience. Already found something interesting?",
    "D2:12": "John said:Mostly just bottle caps, but a couple of times I found coins, and once even a gold ring.",
    "D2:13": "James said:Cool, I wish you good luck in this matter! By the way, I've got something to show you.",
    "D2:14": "John said:Show me what you've got! What is it?",
    "D2:15": "James said:Check out this pic of my best buds having a blast in the park. They've brought so much joy to my life. My two dogs are the best pals ever, right?",
    "D2:16": "John said:They look like they're having a blast! Can they do any tricks?",
    "D2:17": "James said:They can do tricks like sit, stay, paw, and rollover. Here's a picture of Daisy waiting for a treat. I've done lots of training and they've picked it up fast. They're like my family.",
    "D2:18": "John said:Aww, they're adorable! Pets are the best - they must make life so much better. I want one so bad, but I'm not there yet. Someday!",
    "D2:19": "James said:A pet would truly be great for you! They bring so much love and companionship. If you're interested, I can help find the perfect one for you - you'd make a great pet parent!",
    "D2:20": "John said:Cheers, James! Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. Appreciate the offer.",
    "D2:21": "James said:No problem, John! Let me know whenever you need assistance. Take care!",
    "D3:1": "John said:Hey James, long time no see! I had a big win in my game last week - finally advanced to the next level! It was a huge confidence booster and felt like I'd really achieved something.",
    "D3:2": "James said:Hey John, congrats on your win! Games can really boost confidence, huh? I'm challenging myself too - I'm learning this instrument, which has been quite the journey.\n",
    "D3:3": "John said:Thanks, James! I play drums too! Here's a pic of my set.",
    "D3:4": "James said:Wow, looking good! How long have you been playing?",
    "D3:5": "John said:I've been playing for a month now, it's been tough but fun. How about you, how's it going?",
    "D3:6": "James said:This is going great! I started a few days ago, so I'm still picking it up. Been at it daily and seeing improvements. It's tough but rewarding at the same time!",
    "D3:7": "John said:Nice work! Looks like you're doing great. Anything new in general that you'd recommend?",
    "D3:8": "James said:Thanks! I just got a new cutting-edge gaming system and the graphics are incredible. I've been playing all kinds of new games and it's been a great way to relax after work. Plus, I can connect with friends who share my passion for gaming.",
    "D3:9": "John said:Cool, James! Gaming is great for chilling out. Btw, since we last spoke, I had the chance to go to a gaming convention - it was amazing! Tried out loads of games, met developers, and even took part in a tournament - unreal! Check out this pic I took!",
    "D3:10": "James said:Wow, that's awesome! What game was it for? Sounds like a dream!",
    "D3:11": "John said:I played my favorite CS:GO game in an intense tournament. It was awesome to see all the skilled players competing.",
    "D3:12": "James said:Wow, that sounds cool! Gaming is awesome with all the competition. Must have been thrilling to watch those skilled players!",
    "D3:13": "John said:It was indeed amazing! Watching those skilled players really inspired me to improve my own gaming skills.",
    "D3:14": "James said:Nice one, John! Learning from experienced gamers can really help you level up your skills. Keep it up!",
    "D3:15": "John said:I'm always looking to up my game and hit new goals. That same commitment is true for my hobbies and other stuff. What have you been doing to stay motivated?",
    "D3:16": "James said:Setting small goals and tracking my progress helps me stay motivated and focused.",
    "D3:17": "John said:Nice one! Setting small goals and tracking progress is a great way to stay motivated - it helps you stay on track and celebrates progress. Anything specific you're working on or upcoming challenges you're pumped about?",
    "D3:18": "James said:I'm getting into different types of games now, like RPGs and strategy games. It's really exciting!",
    "D3:19": "John said:Cool, James! That sounds exciting. Have fun exploring different genres of games!",
    "D3:20": "James said: I'm super hyped to explore different game genres. Let's see what's in store!",
    "D3:21": "John said:Definitely! Trying new genres is always exciting. I can't wait to hear about your journey with them. Please let me know how it goes!",
    "D3:22": "James said:Got it, John! I'll keep you updated on my gaming adventures with the new genres. Have a good day!",
    "D3:23": "John said:Thanks! Can't wait to hear about it. Bye!",
    "D4:1": "John said:Hey James! Long time no chat. What's up? Been playing any new games lately?",
    "D4:2": "James said:Hey John! Yeah, it's been a while. I've been busy, but I joined an online gaming tournament yesterday. It was so intense and fun! Here is a photo report.",
    "D4:3": "John said:That online gaming tournament looks awesome! Glad you had a blast. How did it go for you?",
    "D4:4": "James said:It was so much fun! I did pretty well in the tournament; I made it to the semis and won some rounds. It was such a rush! Here's a screenshot of my character.",
    "D4:5": "John said:Wow, awesome! Congrats on your performance and making it to the semifinals. How did the final rounds turn out?",
    "D4:6": "James said:Thanks John! The final rounds were tough. I tried my best but didn't make it. It was close, though, and I had a blast competing with talented players. Looking forward to the next tournament!",
    "D4:7": "John said:Met any famous player there?",
    "D4:8": "James said:I met the whole team! It’s a pity I didn’t get a chance to take a photo with them, but one of them even gave me a couple of gaming tips.",
    "D4:9": "John said:Cool! I'm sure his advice will help you develop in the game.",
    "D4:10": "James said:Yes, I'm sure of that too. Also, the whole team gave me autographs. I was very happy about this!",
    "D4:11": "John said:How cool is this! What advice do you remember most?",
    "D4:12": "James said:The most important thing I remember is that you always need to communicate correctly with the team and never put your ego above team success.",
    "D4:13": "John said:Yeah, comms and teamwork are super important in gaming. When everyone works together, it's incredible what can be accomplished in a match. How do you usually communicate with your team?",
    "D4:14": "James said:I usually use voice chat to communicate with my team. It's fast and helps us work together effectively.",
    "D4:15": "John said:Sounds like a good plan. It really helps with communication. What game do you like playing with your team?",
    "D4:16": "James said:I've been playing my favourite game called Apex Legends with my team and it's intense! Check out this screenshot of us playing!",
    "D4:17": "John said:Man, Apex Legends looks tough! The graphics are unreal. How does it stack up against other games?",
    "D4:18": "James said:Apex Legends has awesome graphics and super fast-paced gameplay. It definitely stands out among other games.",
    "D4:19": "John said:Hmm, the speed of it definitely makes it fun! Are there any new games that you're looking forward to trying out?",
    "D4:20": "James said:Yeah, I'm always excited to try new games. Thinking of trying RPGs like that or MOBAs. Sounds cool!",
    "D4:21": "John said:RPGs and MOBAs can be awesome to experience an engaging story or have epic multiplayer fights. Let me know how you like them!",
    "D4:22": "James said:Sure thing, John! Can't wait to try out some new genres. I'll definitely let you know my thoughts once I give them a try.",
    "D4:23": "John said:Love hearing about it. Let's chat soon!",
    "D4:24": "James said:Sure John, I'll keep you updated on all the new games. Talk to you soon! Bye for now!",
    "D4:25": "John said:Let me know how it goes. Stay safe. Talk to you soon. Bye!",
    "D5:1": "James said:Hey John! Long time no chat - I adopted a pup from a shelter in Stamford last week and my days have been so much happier with him in the fam. I named it Ned. Any progress on your gaming goals?",
    "D5:2": "John said:Hey James! Congrats on getting a pup! They really do make days brighter. I haven't made much progress with gaming lately, life's been busy with work and stuff but it's always nice to remember how happy gaming makes me. It's a good way to forget the stresses of life.",
    "D5:3": "James said:Thanks, John! Gaming really does help forget about the stresses of life. It's like heading into another world! Have you played any interesting games lately?",
    "D5:4": "John said:I'm playing this new RPG that has a really cool story and world. It's kinda like getting transported to a futuristic dystopia.",
    "D5:5": "James said:Sounds great! Will I like it? I'm always up for trying new games.",
    "D5:6": "John said:You'll love it! It has a fun story and an awesome world. Plus, it has some tough gameplay. However, the game is a little laggy and sometimes produces errors. Here is one of them that I came across yesterday.",
    "D5:7": "James said:The game must still be raw. I'd rather wait until the bugs are completely fixed, and then I'll try it out.",
    "D5:8": "John said:Even with minor bugs, the game still looks great. The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is super immersive. I'm sure you should try it out now. I can send you a link.",
    "D5:9": "James said:Okay, you convinced me. Well, I'll wait for the link then, thanks!",
    "D5:10": "John said:Cool, I'll send it to you. Let me know what you think after you check it out!",
    "D5:11": "James said:Cool, John! I'll check it out and let you know what I think. I'm excited to give it a try.",
    "D5:12": "John said:Thanks, James! Excited to hear your thoughts. Have a great time!",
    "D5:13": "James said:Cheers! Will do. Enjoy the gaming! Bye!",
    "D5:14": "John said:Bye for now!",
    "D5:15": "James said:See ya! Take care!",
    "D5:16": "John said:Take care!",
    "D6:1": "John said:Hey James! Long time no see! I have great news! Last Tuesday I met three cool new friends in my programming course, they share the same passion as me and it's cool to grow my social circle. Have you had any fun surprises lately?",
    "D6:2": "James said:Hey John! Glad you had a great week meeting new people! Something awesome happened to me last Thursday – I got to work with one of my gaming pals on a programming project! We combined programming and gaming, and created this virtual world inspired by Witcher 3. It was awesome to see our ideas come to life!",
    "D6:3": "John said:It must've felt great to put your skills to work on that project! Do you have any screenshots of the world you made? It must've been so awesome to see it all come together!",
    "D6:4": "James said:It was quite the experience. Unfortunately, I don't have a screenshot of the full virtual world, but I do have a screenshot of the game character I created. It was a lot of work but so rewarding when it all came together. Super satisfying!",
    "D6:5": "John said:Wow, James! This is amazing. I can really feel the atmosphere here. Did you get the inspiration for this from something?",
    "D6:6": "James said:Thanks, I'm glad you can feel the atmosphere. I got the idea from a walk with my dogs two weeks ago. We were walking around our neighborhood, and a stranger was walking towards us. I had never seen her nearby before. Her eyes and appearance amazed me so much, it seemed to me that I fell in love at first sight. It’s a pity that I didn’t approach her to get to know her, but at least I remembered her appearance and embodied it in the game.",
    "D6:7": "John said:That's awesome. Real-life experiences can be so inspiring. It's like the virtual world is connected to the real world. By the way, two days ago I wanted to be alone with nature. This is the canyon I found in the surrounding area. Very calming view.",
    "D6:8": "James said:That's so cool you had a similar experience. I bet you felt inspired seeing it in person.",
    "D6:9": "John said:Capturing that view was amazing. It was like connecting the real and the imaginary. It really sparked my creativity and motivation.",
    "D6:10": "James said:Cool! What else gives you motivation?",
    "D6:11": "John said:I adhere to the principle that only those who rest well work well. Therefore, chilling with friends and traveling always give me motivation to work further.",
    "D6:12": "James said:I agree with you, I also love to travel. Last year I visited Italy, for example. A very beautiful country with delicious food.",
    "D6:13": "John said:Oh, Italy! I always dreamed of visiting there. What other countries have you been to?",
    "D6:14": "James said:In fact, I haven't visited many countries. Besides Italy, I was also in Turkey and Mexico. What was the last country you visited?",
    "D6:15": "John said:This was Japan. The megacities of this country impress me, everything there is so technologically advanced, the huge screens on the buildings are mesmerizing. And, of course, very tasty street food.",
    "D6:16": "James said:It would be cool to go somewhere together next year, don't you think?",
    "D6:17": "John said:Of course, I hope everything works out for us, I will believe in it!",
    "D6:18": "James said:Great, then I'll start looking for a country where we can go!",
    "D6:19": "John said:Keep me posted, James! Let me know if you need help.",
    "D7:1": "John said:Hey James! How's it going?",
    "D7:2": "James said:Hey John! Good to hear from ya. Yeah, been crazy. Last Thursday I took my dogs out for a hike. Was quite the adventure! Explored some nice trails and enjoyed fresh air.",
    "D7:3": "John said:Wow, sounds like quite an adventure! Do you have any pictures from that day?",
    "D7:4": "James said:Yeah, I have one. It was great! They loved it - so many trails to discover and amazing views. So fun!",
    "D7:5": "John said:Wow, that looks like a cool place you took them! Why'd you pick that spot?",
    "D7:6": "James said:I picked that spot because it had great views and lots of trails. It was perfect for them to explore nature and have fun. Plus, there's nothing like being surrounded by lush greenery and clean air.",
    "D7:7": "John said:Agreed! It is a great way to escape the everyday. Wish I could spend more time in nature!",
    "D7:8": "James said:Love hearing the crunch of leaves under my feet and the peacefulness. It helps me clear my head and chill.",
    "D7:9": "John said:I need some chill vibes too because it's been crazy for me lately.",
    "D7:10": "James said:What's been going on? Is there anything you want to talk about? I'm here for you.",
    "D7:11": "John said:Thanks, James. Yeah, been super busy at work. Deadlines all over the place and so much to do. It's just been really hectic lately.",
    "D7:12": "James said:Yeah, work can be tough. Is there something specific that's making it worse?",
    "D7:13": "John said:Ugh, this project is giving me a hard time. It's a difficult assignment that involves coding and I'm stuck on it. It's frustrating because I hate being stuck and not making progress.",
    "D7:14": "James said:Yeah, it's really frustrating when a project doesn't go as planned. What specifically is giving you trouble? Maybe I can offer some assistance.",
    "D7:15": "John said:This coding is really tough. I'm working on something complicated and it's not going well. I've been staring at it for ages and I feel like I'm getting nowhere.",
    "D7:16": "James said:Gotcha, what's the problem with the project? Need a hand figuring out some ideas?",
    "D7:17": "John said:Yeah, that'd be great. I'm trying to make this new algorithm work better, but I'm stuck. Do you have any ideas?",
    "D7:18": "James said:Not sure about your algorithm, but breaking it down into smaller steps might help. Doing some research on similar algorithms or asking other programmers for advice could be beneficial. Don't be afraid to seek help and remember, every problem has a solution.",
    "D7:19": "John said:Yep, breaking it down into smaller steps and asking for help can definitely be helpful. I'll give it a try. Thanks for the advice, James. Much appreciated.",
    "D7:20": "James said:No problem John. Glad to help. You got this. Keep going and you'll find the answer.",
    "D7:21": "John said: Your words really helped. I won't quit. Gonna keep going. Cheers! \n",
    "D8:1": "James said:Hey John! What's up? Anything fun going on?",
    "D8:2": "John said: I'm currently taking on some freelance programming to hone my coding skills. It's challenging, but I'm determined to improve.",
    "D8:3": "James said:Freelancing can definitely be a great way to sharpen skills and gain experience. What projects are you currently working on?",
    "D8:4": "John said:I'm actually working on a website for a local small business. It's my first professional project outside of class.",
    "D8:5": "James said:Congrats on your first professional project, John! Bet it's been great applying what you learned in class. How's the progress been?",
    "D8:6": "John said:Thanks, James! I've learned a lot and it's been an interesting journey so far. Progress is slow and there have been some hiccups along the way.",
    "D8:7": "James said:Yeah, nothing ever goes smooth. It's normal to have hiccups, but use them to learn and grow. Push through it and you'll make it!",
    "D8:8": "John said:You're right, I appreciate the boost. It's tough sometimes but I'm gonna keep pushing and make this work. Hiccups won't stop me.",
    "D8:9": "James said:What challenges have you encountered?",
    "D8:10": "John said:Figuring out how to get payments on the website was tough. I needed some help so I used some resources to understand the process. It's taken a while, but I'm getting closer to a solution.",
    "D8:11": "James said:That sounds challenging, but you're making progress. Hang in there! By the way, three days ago I bought myself an adventure book with fantasy novels and cool arts.",
    "D8:12": "John said:Wow, that art's awesome! It takes me back to reading fantasy books.",
    "D8:13": "James said:Yeah, I love this genre. Got any suggestions?",
    "D8:14": "John said:Cool! Heard of \"The Name of the Wind\"? It's another great novel with awesome writing.",
    "D8:15": "James said:Never heard of it, but it sounds interesting. I'll definitely check it out. Thanks for the recommendation, John!",
    "D8:16": "John said:Always happy to help. I'm sure you'll love this trilogy!",
    "D8:17": "James said:Look, I was playing a game and my faithful furry friend Daisy came and lay down next to me. This is so cute!",
    "D8:18": "John said:Awww, this is really so cute! Your furry friend looks so cozy. Do your dogs often come to you like this while playing?",
    "D8:19": "James said:Yeah, they love to watch me gaming and often hug me. Such good cuddle buddies! What game have you been playing lately?",
    "D8:20": "John said:Awesome that you have them! I'm currently playing AC Valhalla, it's cool. Are you playing anything new?",
    "D8:21": "James said:Thanks, John! Valhalla is awesome. I'm trying out some strategy games like this. It's different but so cool!",
    "D8:22": "John said:Is that Civilization VI? Heard good things about it. How's it?",
    "D8:23": "James said:This is a high-quality turn-based strategy game where you manage resources, lead armies, and conquer territories - challenging and cool!",
    "D8:24": "John said:That sounds fun! What's the game like? Does it require a lot of strategy?",
    "D8:25": "James said:Sure, John! It requires a lot of strategy. It's all about planning, managing resources and making good decisions to beat your rivals. Every move matters!",
    "D8:26": "John said:Sounds intense but cool. I like games that test my strategizing. Does it help with your problem-solving?",
    "D8:27": "James said:Yeah, it's a great way to work on problem-solving and thinking. Plus, it's awesome to see your plans go the way you wanted and win!",
    "D8:28": "John said:Yeah! It's really satisfying when your plans work out and you win. How long have you been playing this game?",
    "D8:29": "James said:Been playing it for a month now - it's really challenged my strategy skills.",
    "D8:30": "John said:Wow, that's impressive! I'm really enjoying games like this, they really make me think. What do you think of strategy board games? I played one with friends two days ago, it's very exciting!",
    "D8:31": "James said:Sounds good! Board games are always a blast when you hang out with friends.",
    "D8:32": "John said:Yeah! They're great for having fun together.",
    "D8:33": "James said:Anything else that is fun to play with others?",
    "D8:34": "John said:Yes, we played one game, but I forgot its name. Perhaps you know this game. There were multi-colored cards with numbers. You can only place a card with the same color or number on your opponent's card. Sometimes you trade cards, sometimes you need to draw a few extra from the deck or skip a turn.",
    "D8:35": "James said:I can't remember such a game. Maybe you have some other interesting games?",
    "D8:36": "John said:Yeah for sure! I've been playing one more game with friends these days. It's a game to figure out who the impostors are and it's super fun.",
    "D8:37": "James said:Sounds cool! I've heard of that game, been meaning to try it out.",
    "D8:38": "John said:Go for it, James! I advise you to gather a large group, it will be much more interesting to play.",
    "D8:39": "James said:Sure thing, sounds like fun.",
    "D8:40": "John said:That really is!",
    "D9:1": "John said:Hey James! How've you been? Had an eventful week since our last chat.",
    "D9:2": "James said:Hey John! Man, it's been wild since we talked. Last Friday, something happened on my project that I've been working on for weeks. I got so close to finishing it but I just couldn't figure it out. Super frustrating.",
    "D9:3": "John said:Ugh, that's rough. I understand how frustrating it can be. What happened with that project of yours?",
    "D9:4": "James said:I hit a major snag - a bug in the code messed up the game mechanics. I tried debugging it for hours but couldn't solve it. It was super disappointing.",
    "D9:5": "John said:Yeah, dealing with those bugs can be frustrating. Did you manage to solve the issue?",
    "D9:6": "James said:Nah, I couldn't figure it out on my own so a group of friends and I teamed up and got it fixed. Took a bit of work, but I'm glad it got done.",
    "D9:7": "John said:Cool! Having a reliable team can really make a difference.",
    "D9:8": "James said:Yeah, totally! It's awesome to have a group of people who share the same passions. They give you help and bring their own ideas to the mix. You can achieve so much when everyone works together. Are you working on anything today?",
    "D9:9": "John said:Nah, I have day-off today. I had a few new friends over to watch some movies. Trying to socialize more and it's been great! I think it's important to balance work and enjoyment. You're welcome to join us next time!",
    "D9:10": "James said:Sounds great, John! I'm definitely in next time. Hanging out with friends and unwinding is key. By the way, today I decided to spend time with my beloved pets again.\n",
    "D9:11": "John said:Cool! They look like they're having a blast. What type are they?",
    "D9:12": "James said:One of them, Daisy, is a Labrador. She loves to play with her toys, but most of all she loves to eat.",
    "D9:13": "John said:Cool, what about the other two? Judging by the photo, shepherds?",
    "D9:14": "James said:Exactly! You would know how much joy they bring me. They are so loyal, and this is their main feature.",
    "D9:15": "John said:Wow, James! Love hearing about the joy that furry friends bring into your life. What else brings you happiness?",
    "D9:16": "James said:My pets, computer games, travel and pizza are all that bring me happiness in life.",
    "D9:17": "John said:Pizza? Cool, I love pizza too! Which one do you love the most?",
    "D9:18": "James said:Pepperoni of course! An amazing combination of spicy salami and cheese.",
    "D9:19": "John said:Cool, but my favorite thing is Hawaiian pizza. This combination of sweet and salty delights me! What other pizza do you like?",
    "D9:20": "James said:I like also cheese pizza and prosciutto.",
    "D9:21": "John said:Haven't tried prosciutto yet, but I've heard it`s great!",
    "D9:22": "James said:Give it a shot! It`s really great. No regrets, I promise.",
    "D9:23": "John said:Got it, will check it out. Thanks!",
    "D9:24": "James said:Be sure to tell us your impressions when you try it! And Bon Appetit!",
    "D9:25": "John said:Thanks! Catch you later!",
    "D10:1": "James said:Hey John! Been a while since we chatted. Sorry 'bout not getting back sooner. How's it going? Any new games you're into?",
    "D10:2": "John said:Hey James! No worries, I know you are really busy at work. I'm good, thanks for asking. Oh, I've been organizing something with my friends yesterday - it was cool! Guess what it was, I'll give you a little hint.",
    "D10:3": "James said:Wow, John, that looks awesome! Is it an icon of a new game?",
    "D10:4": "John said:Nope, not a new game. We put together a tournament for our favorite game, CS:GO. Lots showed up and we made a bunch of money for charity!",
    "D10:5": "James said:Wow John, organizing that tournament for charity must have been a ton of effort, but it sounds like it was so worth it!",
    "D10:6": "John said:Definitely worth it! It took some planning and coordination, but seeing everyone come together for a good cause was so rewarding.",
    "D10:7": "James said:It must have been great to see the results of that effort. Have you considered organizing more events like that in the future?",
    "D10:8": "John said:Yeah, for sure! It was awesome and I want to do more events like that. It combines my interests and helps the community. Plus, it's great to get people together for some friendly competition.",
    "D10:9": "James said:Combining gaming and volunteering is a great idea! So fun and fulfilling. Where did you send the collected money?",
    "D10:10": "John said:Our main goal was to raise money for a dog shelter, which is not far from the street where I live. And we did it!",
    "D10:11": "James said:Helping animals is really important!",
    "D10:12": "John said:I agree. We still had some money left after helping the shelter, and we decided to use this money to buy groceries and cook some food for the homeless. They were very happy about it.",
    "D10:13": "James said:Glad you are helping those in need! You are doing a great job John, keep up the good work!",
    "D10:14": "John said:Thanks for your support, James! I won't stop there, I will do more and more good things!",
    "D10:15": "James said:I'm really proud of you!",
    "D11:1": "John said:Hey James, it's been a bit since we last talked. Something cool happened recently - I volunteered my programming skills for a social cause. It was cool to use my passion to do something good. I made a software tool for one charitable foundation which helped streamline their operations and make them run more smoothly. Seeing my skills making a real difference in the world was really rewarding.",
    "D11:2": "James said:Hey John! Glad to hear from you. It's awesome that you used your skills to make a difference. Bet it was cool to see it in action. Would love to hear more about it!",
    "D11:3": "John said:Previously, this foundation used paper records and all inventory was recorded manually. I made an application that structured their work, and now everything they need for inventory is in one application on their smartphone.",
    "D11:4": "James said:Wow John, that's awesome! Must feel great to be part of something so important. I would love to see any visual examples of the impact your software made.",
    "D11:5": "John said:Yeah, here's a screenshot of the system. It'll make tracking inventory, resources, and donations run smoother and generate reports for analysis. Feels great knowing my skills are making a real difference to them.",
    "D11:6": "James said:Wow John, that's awesome! What motivated you to create such an amazing system for them?",
    "D11:7": "John said:I was inspired by their passion for helping kids, so I wanted to contribute in any way I could. Plus, coding lets me challenge myself and expand my skills, so this was a great chance to do both. It's really rewarding to use my coding skills to make a difference.",
    "D11:8": "James said:That's really great, John! It's awesome how you blended your passion with a good cause. How did it affect you?",
    "D11:9": "John said:It showed me the power of tech to make positive changes, beyond just my own enjoyment. It gave me a real sense of purpose.",
    "D11:10": "James said:Discovering our passions is truly rewarding. How do you think this experience will impact your future plans?",
    "D11:11": "John said:This experience has given me a clearer sense of purpose and motivated me to use my programming skills to make a positive impact. I'm now considering volunteer roles and potentially a career in the non-profit sector.",
    "D11:12": "James said:That's really inspiring. Have you found any non-profit organizations that align with your values and passion for programming?",
    "D11:13": "John said:I haven’t found it yet, but to be honest I haven’t looked for it. I think it won’t be difficult for me to find the organization I need.",
    "D11:14": "James said:There are lots of places where you can show off your skills! I'm sure you'll find one that's perfect for you in making a difference.",
    "D11:15": "John said:I'll be happy to find a place where my skills and passions are a perfect match. I'm hoping to make a positive impact there.",
    "D11:16": "James said:I'm sure you'll find the right spot, John. Your skills and passions will be a great addition. Good luck!",
    "D11:17": "John said:Thanks, your encouragement means a lot.",
    "D11:18": "James said:I'm here for you. Good luck!",
    "D11:19": "John said:Thanks, James! Appreciate it. Take care and talk soon!",
    "D12:1": "James said:Hey John, last weekend I had an awesome time at the amusement park with my friends. It was a great break from the virtual world. I went on some awesome roller coasters and it reminded me of when I was a kid. Everything was so real and exciting; it felt like I was in a video game!",
    "D12:2": "John said:Hey James! Sounds like an awesome time! I bet those rides brought back some great memories. Were there any other attractions besides the roller coaster?",
    "D12:3": "James said:Of course, I also managed to ride the Ferris wheel, electric cars and buggies. What's new with you?",
    "D12:4": "John said:That's really cool! Last Friday I entered a local tournament and took second place! It was a wild experience and the competitive energy was insane.",
    "D12:5": "James said:Wow, John that's awesome! Congrats on your achievement! I can imagine the rush you must have felt during the tournament. Did you receive any rewards or prizes for your success?",
    "D12:6": "John said:I was stoked about my achievement. Though I didn't win the tournament, I still received some money for the 2nd place. Seeing my effort pay off was awesome.",
    "D12:7": "James said:Awesome news! You don't have to win every time, growth and progress are most important. ",
    "D12:8": "John said:Yeah, I also got this trophy! So satisfying. It reminds me to always put in my best effort. What about you? Any success stories lately?",
    "D12:9": "James said:Congrats on your achievement, John! That trophy looks awesome. Last month, I had a personal milestone. There were definitely tough times, but it reminds me of all the hard work. I feel a huge sense of accomplishment and I'm ready for the future opportunities!",
    "D12:10": "John said:Congrats on the milestone. What was it and what made it challenging? What did you learn?",
    "D12:11": "James said:I finished a big project I had been working on for months. It was challenging because I had to learn a new language and handle many details. I learned a lot about problem-solving, patience, and perseverance. Now I feel more confident to take on even bigger projects.",
    "D12:12": "John said: That's awesome you learned a language and handled all those details. Great job, you definitely picked up some great skills! Remember, determination and confidence make any project a success. Good work!",
    "D12:13": "James said:Thanks, I appreciate your support. I'll definitely keep that in mind.",
    "D12:14": "John said:No worries, I'm here to help. Keep going and reach those goals!",
    "D13:1": "John said:Hey James, long time no talk! A lot has happened during this time. Let me fill you in.",
    "D13:2": "James said:Hey John! Awesome to hear from you. Yeah, a lot has happened. Let's catch up!",
    "D13:3": "John said:I finally got my dream job! After lots of interviews and late nights, I got the offer and was ecstatic. Can't wait to start my journey!",
    "D13:4": "James said:Wow, John! Congrats on getting your dream job. I'm super stoked for you. When do you start?",
    "D13:5": "John said:Thank you! ! I'm starting next month.",
    "D13:6": "James said:It can be rough getting started, but I'm sure you'll do great. Don't be afraid to seek help if you need it. Can't wait to hear about your experience! By the way, I recently started a course that combines my passion for gaming and programming. It's fun and challenging, and it has definitely increased my excitement for both.",
    "D13:7": "John said:Cool! That sounds awesome. Combining your love of gaming and coding sounds like a dream. Tell me more! Are there any interesting projects you're working on?",
    "D13:8": "James said:Yes, we are currently working on a new part of the football simulator. I was working on collecting player databases. It wasn't easy, but I did it!",
    "D13:9": "John said:Cool! Did you choose this course because you love football?",
    "D13:10": "James said:Not least because of this. I love football, but, of course, the most important reason is to improve yourself. But it’s nice if it’s also connected with something you like.",
    "D13:11": "John said:I completely agree! By the way, did you watch the Liverpool vs Chelsea match?",
    "D13:12": "James said:Of course, they played well! As I like to say, there is no sport better than football, no club better than Liverpool! I don't miss a single match of theirs!",
    "D13:13": "John said:It looks like you really root for this team!",
    "D13:14": "James said:Absolutely! They are forever in my heart, they are a great team. I hope they become champions next season!",
    "D13:15": "John said:As a Manchester City fan, I can't agree with you. You'll see, our two teams will fight for the championship, and mine will win!",
    "D13:16": "James said:I'm sure you're wrong, John. Manchester City are in bad form and their transfer policy is terrible!",
    "D13:17": "John said:You may be right, but the City manager can handle it, you'll see!",
    "D13:18": "James said:I bet we'll be higher than you in the final standings!",
    "D13:19": "John said:I'll take the bet, James! This will be a great battle!",
    "D13:20": "James said:Sure, John!",
    "D14:1": "James said:Hey John, how's it going? A lot has happened for me lately, some good and some not so great. I`m lucky to have at least two people who always help me out when I'm struggling. What about you?",
    "D14:2": "John said:Gad to hear you have your support system ready. It's crucial, especially during hard times. For me, it's been quite an emotional rollercoaster. Last week, I started my blog about coding. It's exciting and kinda scary too. This is the first picture I uploaded there.",
    "D14:3": "James said:Wow, starting a blog about coding is awesome! Must be so exciting. What do you think about it?",
    "D14:4": "John said:Thanks, James! It has been an awesome and challenging experience. I'm loving sharing my coding journey with others and tracking everything. It's a great way to connect with other coders.",
    "D14:5": "James said:Congrats on your coding journey! What`s more new in your world?",
    "D14:6": "John said:Well, I bought a lot of new books, and now my bookcase is almost completely filled!",
    "D14:7": "James said:What genre do you enjoy reading?",
    "D14:8": "John said:I'm a big fan of sci-fi and fantasy books. Epic fantasy series with immersive world-building and intricate storylines are what I enjoy reading. Just getting lost in the pages of a great story is a wonderful escape from reality.",
    "D14:9": "James said:Cool! Are there any book series that you love and would recommend to others?",
    "D14:10": "John said:Definitely! Two of my favorites are \"The Stormlight Archive\" and \"Kingkiller Chronicle\". If SF is your thing, check out \"The Expanse\" series. It's epic!",
    "D14:11": "James said:Thanks for the recommendations, John! I'll definitely check out those books. What makes them your favorites?",
    "D14:12": "John said:Glad you're giving these books a try! I'm obsessed with the way they create a magical world you can escape into - plus the characters feel really real. By the way, what's the name of the dog in this picture from your Facebook? It`s so cute!",
    "D14:13": "James said:This is Max – he's so lovable and playful. He brings me so much joy, especially in tough times.",
    "D14:14": "John said:Aww, he's adorable! I can tell Max brings you a lot of happiness. Pets are always such a great source of joy and love.",
    "D14:15": "James said:Yeah, Max is great - he always cheers me up when I'm feeling down. Enjoying those cuddles with him!",
    "D14:16": "John said:Does he enjoy swimming?",
    "D14:17": "James said:Yeah, he loves it! We usually hit the beach or lake, and he loves playing in the water. He's a pro swimmer!",
    "D14:18": "John said:Max must be having so much fun swimming and playing - it's the best!",
    "D14:19": "James said:He has a blast! Always a joy to see him so happy and carefree in his favorite activity.",
    "D14:20": "John said:He looks so happy - this is a great achievement of yours!",
    "D14:21": "James said:Thanks, John! I love making him happy.",
    "D14:22": "John said:Does Max have any special talents? He seems like quite the go-getter!",
    "D14:23": "James said:Max is a real go-getter! He's awesome at catching frisbees in mid-air - never misses!",
    "D14:24": "John said:Wow, Max loves playing fetch! Does he also enjoy long walks?",
    "D14:25": "James said:Yep! We love them; they're great exercise and give us fresh air. Here is a photo of us from a recent walk in the forest.",
    "D14:26": "John said:Where's that spot where you could take a stroll? Bet Max loves all those hikes.",
    "D14:27": "James said:Max and I love taking walks on this nearby trail. It's a mile from my house. It's so tranquil and a great way to relax and connect with nature.",
    "D14:28": "John said:Wow, that looks awesome! Going for a nature walk is so refreshing, don't you think?",
    "D14:29": "James said:Yeah, John! It's so relaxing and refreshing. It helps me think straight and find my inner peace.",
    "D14:30": "John said:That park is so peaceful. What do you do when you're there alone?",
    "D14:31": "James said:When I'm there, I usually bring a book and just chill. It's like an escape from reality.",
    "D14:32": "John said:Sounds great, James! Taking breaks and switching up the scenery is a great way to feel recharged. Keep it up.",
    "D14:33": "James said:Definitely! Taking breaks is important for recharging. Thanks for the support!",
    "D14:34": "John said:No problem, always here to have your back. Take care of yourself!",
    "D15:1": "James said:Hey John, since our last chat, something awesome happened. Last Friday, I started introducing Max, Daisy and the new pup Ned. It was hard at first, but they're slowly adapting. It's sweet to watch them bond and have fun together.",
    "D15:2": "John said:Wow, that's cool, James! Seeing them bonding and having a great time is so sweet. Do you have a picture of them together?",
    "D15:3": "James said:Yep, I got a great pic last night. Check it out!",
    "D15:4": "John said:Wow, they look so cute! I can almost feel the love and joy in this photo. These last few days really got me thinking about my own future.",
    "D15:5": "James said:What's been on your mind regarding the future?",
    "D15:6": "John said:Lately, I've been thinking about my career and where I want to be in the future. I'm driven and passionate, and I also want to make a positive impact on the world.",
    "D15:7": "James said:Gotcha, John. Finding a way to make a difference matters. Have you thought about any ideas on how to do that?",
    "D15:8": "John said:Yeah, I have. I've been looking into volunteering and thinking of going into non-profit work. I want to put my passions and abilities to use for causes I really care about.",
    "D15:9": "James said:Wow, John that sounds great! I'm sure with your skills and passion, you could do some really cool things with nonprofits. Here's a pic I took when I volunteered last month. It was really rewarding to see how little gifts can do so much!",
    "D15:10": "John said:That's awesome, James! Was it cool to see the impact of the gifts? Can you tell me more about the organization you volunteered with?",
    "D15:11": "James said:It was great to see how much a simple act of kindness can mean to someone in need. I volunteered with an organization that provides necessary items to those who are less fortunate. It felt so rewarding to help, even if it was in a small way.",
    "D15:12": "John said:I think this is exactly what I need. Can you take me there this weekend?",
    "D15:13": "James said:Of course I can! I think there are still some of the previous staff there and I can even introduce you to them.",
    "D15:14": "John said:Thank you very much! Will there be some kind of interview required?",
    "D15:15": "James said:No, this is not necessary. All you need is to be a friendly and polite person, and also have a great desire to help people. I'm sure you will succeed!",
    "D15:16": "John said:Thanks for your support! I want to make this world a better place, and with your help I will definitely achieve my goal.",
    "D15:17": "James said:We can do this together!",
    "D15:18": "John said:Thanks, James. Your support means a lot to me. I'm determined to make a positive impact.",
    "D15:19": "James said:You got this! Stay focused on your dreams and don't give up.",
    "D16:1": "James said:Hey John! Long time no talk - hope you're doing well. Guess what? Last week I actually won an online gaming tournament! It was such an exciting experience and it blew my mind when I won. Winning felt so good and it really motivated me to keep improving.",
    "D16:2": "John said:Hey James! Congrats on winning the online gaming tournament! It's super fulfilling to see your hard work pay off. So happy for you!",
    "D16:3": "James said:Thanks! It was really fulfilling to see my hard work pay off with a victory in the tournament. How are you?",
    "D16:4": "John said:Feeling the tug of emotion lately. Determined and passionate on one hand, but feeling overwhelmed and stressed on the other. Balancing personal and professional is kind of a challenge. How have you been?",
    "D16:5": "James said:Yeah, staying balanced can be tough. I'm trying to take breaks from my hobbies and do other things. Lately I've become interested in extreme sports. Yesterday, for example, I was doing rope jumping. The highest height I jumped from was 150 meters!",
    "D16:6": "John said:Wow, how cool! What other extreme sport have you tried?",
    "D16:7": "James said:Just three days ago, I was surfing. Catching a wave is so cool! It's strange, but it relaxes me so much. How do you like to relax?",
    "D16:8": "John said:I like to relax by reading. I love entering the imaginative worlds of authors - it's a fun escape from reality. ",
    "D16:9": "James said:I also love to read, especially while snuggled under the covers on a cold winter day. But now it’s summer and I want something more exciting! By the way, I bought air tickets to Toronto, and I’m leaving the day after tomorrow evening.",
    "D16:10": "John said:Cool, this is already the fourth country you will visit! Will you only be in Toronto, or will you be visiting somewhere else?",
    "D16:11": "James said:I also plan to visit Vancouver. Maybe, I'll go somewhere else.",
    "D16:12": "John said:When are you coming back?",
    "D16:13": "James said:I plan to return on July 20, I’ll definitely bring you some kind of souvenir!",
    "D16:14": "John said:Thanks James! I will be waiting for you from your journey! Bon Voyage!",
    "D16:15": "James said:Thank you, John! Take care and see you soon!",
    "D16:16": "John said:Take care, bye!",
    "D17:1": "John said:Hi James! I just started playing chess to get better at strategy. I'm loving it! Have you ever tried it out?",
    "D17:2": "James said:Hey John! Yeah, I've played chess before. It's a game that really tests your strategy. It's great that you're enjoying it!",
    "D17:3": "John said:Yeah, chess is really fun! It's like solving an endless puzzle and always trying to outwit your opponent.",
    "D17:4": "James said:Yeah, it's tough, but fun when you figure it out. Do you play with friends or online?",

    "D17:15": "John said:This is from when we were 10 and we were really into skateboarding. We had a group of friends who often go to the skate park with. We would help each other learn new tricks and have a great time. Those friends made the experience even better and their friendship meant a lot to us.",
    "D17:16": "James said:Indeed, I remember this moment. We loved skateboards back then, sometimes we even left class early to do it. I still like to go for a ride sometimes, and I even taught my dogs how to balance on it.",
    "D17:17": "John said:Wow! Do they enjoy it, or do you have to encourage them to play with the board?",
    "D17:18": "James said:They love it! They chase after it and run with it. It's a great way for them to get some exercise.",

    "D21:9": "James said:Wow, sounds cool John! Learning coding with a text-based adventure game is impressive stuff. As for me, I've been trying out different genres of games and now I'm dying to create a strategy game like Civilization - love how complicated and in-depth they are. Fingers crossed, one day I'll make my own awesome strategy game!",
    "D21:10": "John said:Wow, James, that's impressive! It's gonna be awesome. Can't wait to see what you come up with!",
    "D21:11": "James said: Are you free tomorrow?",
    "D21:12": "John said:Yes, tomorrow is my day off. Do you have any suggestions on how to spend tomorrow?",
    "D21:13": "James said:Yes, we can go to Starbucks for coffee if you want.",
    "D21:14": "John said:I don't mind meeting up, but why Starbucks? Maybe we can have a beer somewhere?",
    "D21:15": "James said:Well, how about we go to McGee's pub then? I heard they serve a great stout there!",
    "D21:16": "John said:Great idea, except I don't like dark beer. Maybe there's something else there?",
    "D21:17": "James said:Of course, there are also light beers!",
    "D21:18": "John said:Great, then I agree! See you tomorrow at McGee's Pub!",
    "D21:19": "James said:See you John, bye!",

    "D22:4": "John said:This game looks great! What inspired you to create it?",
    "D22:5": "James said:I've always loved playing strategy games like Civilization and Total War, so I decided to challenge myself and create one of my own.",
    "D22:6": "John said:That's awesome! I love those games too. It must have been quite an experience making your own. Did you face any difficulties during development?",
    "D22:7": "James said:It was a bit challenging to get everything right, balancing mechanics and ensuring fairness. But with some trial and error, I managed to get it to where I wanted it.",

    "D23:1": "James said:Hey John, it's been a few days since we talked. So much has gone on, both good and bad. Yesterday, when we were at the theater, Samantha loves theater, I asked her to become my girlfriend, and she agreed. We have gone through a lot in this short period. There were good and bad, but I'm happy with her. All that ups and downs were a bit overwhelming, but it's part of life. What about you? Anything interesting lately?",
    "D23:2": "John said:Hey James, this is great news! Where else have you been besides the theater? My parents just started learning coding from me - it's been a learning experience, but I'm glad to help them out. It binds us a little closer. Look at this photo, this is my father coding his own program for the first time.\n ",
    "D23:3": "James said:That's great, John! Looks like he's having a good time in the pic. Samantha and I were also at McGee's bar. It turned out that she loves a good lager beer. She and I have so much in common!",
    "D23:4": "John said:I'm glad you finally found someone other than dogs that brings you joy. Well done, you will succeed!",
    "D23:5": "James said:Thanks, John. She and I are going to a baseball game next Sunday, want to join? I'll show you what Samantha looks like.",
    "D23:6": "John said:Yeah! Let's do it. It'll be a fun experience!",
    "D23:7": "James said:Great. Well, what else is new in your life?",

    "D23:12": "John said:I really hope so too. Well, do you have anything new besides the great news about you and Samantha?",
    "D23:13": "James said:Yes, two days ago I signed up for a cooking class. I never liked cooking, but I felt that I wanted to learn something new. At the first lesson we prepared several simple dishes. I got a great omelette the first time!",
    "D23:14": "John said:Cool! I’ve never heard of your desire to cook, you surprise me! How much do these cooking courses cost and what else did you cook there?",
    "D23:15": "James said:At only $10 per class, it's very cheap! Also, I made meringue there and they taught us how to make the dough.",
    "D23:16": "John said:Really cheap. It's great that you are always looking for a way to improve yourself!",
    "D23:17": "James said:Thanks for your support, John! I really appreciate it. I hope I can treat you to my creation once I learn a little more about cooking.",

    "D23:21": "James said:Take care, John, bye!",
    "D24:1": "John said:Hey James! Long time no see! A lot's changed since we talked. I started getting into board games. I tried one last week and it turned out to be a lot of fun. What's new with you?",
    "D24:2": "James said:Hey John! Cool, what kind of board game is this? I had a lot to do all this time. And in order not to forget to do something, I started writing down everything I needed in a notebook.",
    "D24:3": "John said:This game is called \"Dungeons of the Dragon\", very exciting! I'm really glad you're writing down what you need to do in a notebook. This will definitely help you not to forget anything! How did you come up with this idea? In general, where do you get ideas?",
    "D24:4": "James said:Thanks, John! I get them from various sources like books, movies, and even dreams.",

    "D24:7": "John said:Wow, dreams can be so awesome! Are there any specific details you remember from that one?",
    "D24:8": "James said:I remember there was a medieval castle with its own labyrinth full of puzzles and traps. It felt like playing a video game in real life!",
    "D24:9": "John said:Wow, exploring a castle with puzzles and traps sounds awesome! Have you got any sketches or notes from that experience? I'd love to take a look!",
    "D24:10": "James said:Yep! I made some sketches and notes. Hang on, let me grab them.",
    "D24:11": "John said:Nice sketch! Do you like music, or is it related to your castle dream?",
    "D24:12": "James said:Thanks! Music is a big part of my life - nothing to do with castles though. What kind of music do you like? Do you play any instruments?",
    "D24:13": "John said:Cool! I'm into electronic and rock music. I used to play drums when I was younger, but haven't in a while. Do you play any instruments?",
    "D24:14": "James said:Yeah, rock's awesome! I used to play a guitar when I was younger but haven't in a while.",
    "D24:15": "John said:Playing drums when I was younger was a fun way to let off steam. Here's a photo of an old drum set I used to play on.",
    "D24:16": "James said:Cool! Have you ever been in a band or just jammed with friends?",
    "D24:17": "John said:I've jammed with friends before, it was a lot of fun!",
    "D24:18": "James said:Sounds awesome! Jamming with friends is always a blast. Do you have any recordings or videos of those sessions?",
    "D24:19": "John said:Nah, it was more about the experience and the moment. No recordings or videos from the jams.",
    "D24:20": "James said:No problem! It's nice to just enjoy the experience without worrying about collecting videos or recordings. By the way, I started streaming games. No details yet, I hope everything works out.",
    "D24:21": "John said:I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! You will definitely succeed, I look forward to the details!",
    "D25:1": "John said:Hey James, been a few days since we chatted. Lots of stuff goin' on in my life!",
    "D25:2": "James said:Hey John! What new has happened in your life?",
    "D25:3": "John said:Yesterday I started a new startup - portable smokers. Now, I’ve already welded one from metal. Do you think it looks good? How about you, any cool stuff happening?",
    "D25:4": "James said:Hey John, that looks great! Seeing it makes me think of campfires with pals. Last night I streamed a game and wow, was I blown away by all the nice comments from the gaming community. I felt so stoked and inspired to keep going. ",

    "D25:9": "John said:Thanks James! I kept it a secret because I would have been very upset if I had told you about her in advance and then it wouldn't have worked out. I've been working on this for the past few months and I'm really proud of how it's turned out. It's a 2D adventure game with puzzles and exploration. Here's a screenshot.",

    "D28:4": "John said:Ugh, that stinks! Losing power in the middle of a game is such a bummer. Did it mess up your progress?",
    "D28:5": "James said:Oof, it definitely messed up my progress. I lost some of it because I forgot to save. Frustrating, but now I know to save more often!",

    "D28:15": "James said:Yeah! Trying new stuff keeps us on our toes and helps our creativity. Awesome that you're down to experiment and see what you can come up with. I'm looking to branch out as well, any ideas I could check out?",

    "D28:19": "James said:I'll reach out if I need help. Thanks for the resources, really appreciate it. By the way, my mother came to see me with her army friend two days ago. We had fun.",
    "D28:20": "John said:Cool. Mother's friend must still be in the army?",
    "D28:21": "James said:Yes, she is still serving. But she retired a long time ago. They used to tell me stories about their time in the military and their pup. Funny enough, I have a pic of me at their age playing on their old gaming setup. Would you like to see it?",
    "D28:22": "John said:Yeah, James! Show me that picture of you playing on their old gaming setup, it looks like a blast!",

    "D28:25": "James said:Oh yeah! I had a blast with it when I was a kid. It was my first gaming system and I'd play Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda for hours. It totally sparked my passion for gaming.",
    "D28:26": "John said:Wow, James! Those games really sparked your passion for gaming, didn't they?",
    "D28:27": "James said:Those games introduced me to gaming and I've been hooked ever since. By the way, yesterday I tried Cyberpunk 2077. Great game, so addictive!",

    "D28:29": "James said:What do you think is the most difficult thing about this game?",

    "D28:31": "James said:Thank you very much, I will definitely keep this in mind!",
    "D28:32": "John said:And remember, you don't have to be friends with every character in this game. I don't want to spoil it, but just remember this!",

    "D28:34": "John said:Always happy to help. Well, I have to go! Bye!",

    "D29:11": "John said:You love spending time together in this bar, don't you?",
    "D29:12": "James said:We just love it! I’ll be honest, one of the criteria for our choice of apartment was this particular bar nearby.",

    "D30:11": "James said:Sure, I'd love to check out some resources on chess openings. Thank you!",
    "D30:12": "John said:I've got you covered on that. Here's a helpful resource for chess openings. Happy to help!",
    "D30:13": "James said:Thanks for the suggestion, John. What games are you currently playing? I'm always looking for new recommendations.",
    "D30:14": "John said:I'm hooked on this great game called FIFA 23. This is a great football game with the ability to play online with other players from all over the world! Enjoy!",
    "D30:15": "James said:Wow, that sounds awesome! I just wanted to try a new gaming genre, so why not try the sports genre.",
    "D30:16": "John said:You need to practice a little first, and then we can play together.",
    "D30:17": "James said:Great idea! I hope it's easy to control.",
    "D30:18": "John said:Not at all, all you need is a gamepad and a sense of timing.",
    "D30:19": "James said:Great! Well, I'll go train!",
    "D31:1": "James said:Hey John! Guess what? Me and my family are currently on the road trip! We`ve already visited my friends Josh and Mark and had such a great time!",

    "D31:12": "John said:Cool! What was it like visiting the animal sanctuary? Did you feel tempted to bring any furry pals home?",
    "D31:13": "James said:Those rescue dogs were so cute, I wanted to take them all home, but I remembered that I already have three dogs at home. I think having more than three dogs is too much.",
    "D31:14": "John said:You are right! I still haven’t gotten a dog, but I still really want one. What is it like to have a dog?",

    "D31:20": "John said:Definitely, James! Dogs are amazing. They bring so much joy and positivity. They accept us without judgement, just love and happiness. I appreciate the daily dose of positivity they bring to my life. Special buddies for sure. By the way, here is my cousin's dog.",
